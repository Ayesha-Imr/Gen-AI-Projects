# RAG Projects

A repo for various different RAG implementations I have done over time, for different use cases and projects.

Includes text RAG, image RAG, multimodal RAG, data extraction and curation pipelines and vector search pipelines.

Very scattered at the moment, I am working on organising it an dadding documentation.
