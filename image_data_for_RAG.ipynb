I\\'d like to welcome you to\\nour next session titled, \"The One About Control.\" Please help me welcome our speaker, Sri, Deputy CISO at Genpact, to the stage. (audience claps) - Thank you everyone. Thanks for making it here. I stand between you and Alicia Keys. I know. A tough job, right? She has a tough act to follow, isn\\'t it? I take it that way. There\\'s apparently some sort of similarity between two of us. We were born in the same month. Beyond that, I can\\'t near\\nmatch her skills on stage. So you have to do with me for today. My name is Sriram. I go by Sri, make it easier\\nfor everybody\\'s life. What I\\'m gonna share today is my opinion. I would not like it to be\\nattributed to the employer, past, present, or future, but I\\'m hoping that\\nyou\\'ll enjoy the session. And what\\'s with the title? Some people say titles don\\'t matter. Sometimes they do, right? I\\'m assuming the presence\\nthat I have in the room here also got intrigued with the title. \"The One About Controls.\" It does have a inspiration,\\nif I can say that, from one of the very\\nfamous television series, mostly in the States, right? And I\\'m hoping some of\\nthat humor might rub off. If I don\\'t, please raise\\nyour hand, yell at me, scream at me, and we\\'ll\\nhave a conversation. The second part, there\\'s\\na camera right there. I\\'m told there may be an option that you may get called for\\nHollywood or some other roles. If you engage with me, maybe I\\'ll take you up with\\nthat role as well, right? Alright, thank you so\\nmuch for making it here. I\\'m gonna start here. We\\'ve already covered the disclaimer. Now, in the 19 late\\nthirties and early forties, Abram Maslow came up with the idea of what does the human\\ngets motivation with? The ideas prang around the fact that everybody behaves\\nthings needs differently. And that is determined by\\neither the circumstance or the current need to fulfill something, some real thing or some\\naspirational things. Now, in his mind, everybody\\nwants to make sure that their safety needs\\nare done first, right? You need your home, you need your shelter, you need your food. Beyond which is where you want to go to the fancy cars, right? So that\\'s the principle of how I thought about thinking\\nabout controls as well. When you think about controls, there is a huge list of things\\nyou can do and want to do. But then, what you really need is\\nsomething that is determined either by your circumstance or by the fact that it\\'s\\nthe need for your business or by the fact that it\\'s\\nsomething that you like. It may not be required for the company. It does happen. I\\'m sure some of you may\\nappreciate that context. Now, Abraham Maslow also thought about in his original 1943, I\\nbelieve, depiction as a pyramid, like the one that I was showing you. But I\\'d like you to think\\nabout it differently. All of us have phases in life. We go up and down. Imagine yourself plucking\\nthe fruit from this tree. If you\\'re in a pyramid format, do you think you\\'re going to\\nget the fruit from every level? Probably not, right? The ripest fruit usually is\\nalso in the bottom, right, that also gets plucked the fastest. Think about it this way. So you go up and down in life, you go up and down in adjusting\\nyour controls as well. That is the premise I\\'m\\ngonna share with you with some of my thoughts. All right. If you\\'ve been to London, imagine that wonderful weather and meet Ana, recently born, right? Ana grew up and was born\\ninto a very affluent family, the richest in the London. She grew up to... She kind of grew, had\\nstuff that she needed. She made sure... No, her parents made sure that she had the education she needed. Remember, she\\'s affluent, but her need to prove herself\\nto the world was immense. That drove her to do studies in law. She became a very prominent lawyer over her journey of life, right? But then after a certain point, money, fame, the fancy cars, the fancy house probably\\ndon\\'t make enough sense. You probably need to make sure that the self-actualization kicks in. You wanna give back to the society. And that\\'s where she was. She went ahead and made a point\\nto give back to the society by being pro bono to a lot of these social\\ncauses back in London. I want you to keep this\\nthought with you for a moment and then say hello to Ramamoorthy. Say hello. We also call him Rama. This chap grew up in a city\\ncalled Bangalore back in India, which is where I\\'m from, not very far from this chap\\'s house, driving distance. Now Rama wanted to be doing\\nsomething very different in the space of, you know,\\nit\\'s a startup cultures. Standing in front of you in Bay area, not talking about startup is going to be like crime, I guess. So Rama wanted to establish\\nsomething of a startup product in the city of Bangalore. The conditions are different. The city is different. The ecosystem is different, but not really. So he wanted to establish\\nhimself as a player in the cloud. He wanted, he figured out a problem that accounts payable\\nthat companies need to do aren\\'t sufficient, and he wanted to make\\nsure there\\'s a product to do just that. And that\\'s what he figured\\nout and went about. Now, he wanted his website to have a certain set of features. He wanted to make sure it\\'s\\naccessible to his B2B customers. And those features were\\nmaking sense to them. And that\\'s how he grew. He made sure he made enough millions and sort of set down his journey to make the product a success. So we\\'ll come back to him in a bit. At some point, these two stories merge. And no, I\\'m not talking about any matrimonial connections here. The two story come together\\nbecause Rama went global and he needed a global lawyer. Say hello to Ana. All right. Now, coming back to the\\ncore of the topic: controls. I\\'d like to define controls as something that you run, manage, direct or restrain to a certain desired outcome. Right? Now they are needs, like we\\'re discussing earlier. Some are real, you need them. Or some are aspirational, you probably don\\'t need them. Or maybe not just now. It\\'s an idea that\\'s whose\\ntime may not have come. I\\'d like to think about the\\ncontrols in a lifecycle format and that\\'s what I\\'m gonna share with you. Think about the lifecycle where it starts with\\nidentification of controls and goes through a process of selection, implementation, its validation,\\nand its refinement, right? So there are regulations that can impact. There are... There\\'s supposed to be an\\nanimation here, by the way. NIST standards, standards such as NIST can come about and influence that. Your decision to choose\\nISO series, for example, can influence that. Or the standards like PCIDSS and so on. Okay. Now it comes. I spoke ahead of myself, I guess. The cool thing to remember here that there will be some intersection. The size is not a representation\\nof the intersection, okay? It\\'s just visual that I\\nwanted to convey to you that most of these standards, most of these requirements will overlap. Okay? Just bear that in mind. All right. So once you have the set of\\ncontrols you wish to acquire or wish to work on, you may want to classify\\nthem in some form or fashion. Humans like to keep things\\nin some structure, isn\\'t it? So that\\'s the approach that\\nI\\'m gonna propose to you. You could go it by domains that are commonly known\\nin the cyber world, like identity and access. You could do the rest of\\nthe others like perimeter, do it on the cloud, do it by physical security\\nand what have you. Don\\'t forget the human element there. But don\\'t forget the process there, right? The element of controls\\nthat you need in a process and we\\'ll soon discover\\nwhy that\\'s relevant will become important for\\nthe overall functioning to the business objective\\nof the control structure. All right, you may also, the world famous cybersecurity\\nframework, version two, NIST adapt to that. I\\'m not expecting you to read this visual, but essentially choose\\na method that you fit, you find fit. All right. I also want to think about controls in some sort of a structure again, such as controls have domains, domains have subdomains, and those subdomains\\nhave control objectives. One or more. Each of those control objectives by itself may have one or\\nmore control statements. Each of those control statements by itself will have some requirements or configuration elements. All right. Now here comes Rama again, right? Remember he is starting his business, he is establishing. He is going global. He wants to do a little\\nbit of, you know, choices. So what did he do? He, let\\'s say we stick to\\nthe domain of identity and access management. He chose these three areas. Obviously, these are examples. The ellipse, the last bottom box there\\nindicates there are more choices. We are just gonna stick to two. Let\\'s say he focuses on\\nauthentication and authorization. If you pick up the authentication, these are the three choices of control objectives we\\nare gonna cover today. One, he\\'s making sure that when he makes his app available to consumers or businesses, he wants individual to\\nhave unrestricted access or do access, and then he wants to make sure\\nthat accounts are kept safe. I shouldn\\'t be able to access this gentleman\\'s\\ndata for example, right? For that, he wanted to make\\nsure that while this happens, the authentication method should meet complex password requirements. That is his vision. And for that, there are some more requirements which are more specific to okay, A, B, and C control\\nelements configuration wise. Okay. And authorization wise,\\nlet\\'s say he goes there and talks about\\nmultifactor authentication. All right. Having chosen what he wants to, like regulations, like ISO series. These are his choices, mind you. Your choices may be different. He thinks that threat\\nintelligence is important for his universe of controls\\nor the Mitre framework or CISs for that matter. CIS for that matter. By the way, I do not represent any of\\nthese organizations, right? And if you look at that section, maybe he wants to focus on what the regulators\\nand the customers need, what the company\\'s objectives are. Remember he wants to go global,\\nhe wants to make big money and wants to make sure his\\napplication is successful and the culture element of it. There is another constraint\\nin this ecosystem. Not enough capability or\\ncapacity will be available, isn\\'t it? There is just won\\'t be enough\\namount of money to put in. So that capability and that\\ncapacity becomes relevant. And for me, what\\'s\\nimportant in this choice is what the focus should be. Of course, the dollars. If you don\\'t have the dollars, there\\'s none of this is gonna be true. So how does he go about\\nselecting some of them? So let\\'s say, we\\'ll take four examples. Let\\'s say from the regulation space, he says the process reports that the operations generate\\nshall need to be secure. Right? He says the ISO standard tells him to have multifactor authentication. Or for that matter, the threat intel requires digital rights as a measure to be introduced\\nfor his company\\'s brand. And finally, from the Mitre framework, relevant application input\\ncontrols are required. Remember, this is payment\\napplication, right? So he found it fit to implement or choose that, select that. But remember we spoke about\\ncapacity, capability and cost. All four were not possible for him. So he chose these three. Okay, having chosen, somebody has to go and do the job now. And that\\'s the piece where I come to the configuration element here. Okay. If I\\'m going too fast, you can raise your hand and let me know. So let\\'s say if he distill\\nthe regulations part, the process controls to\\nbe relevant and secure, he chose these two\\nelements of broad controls of how he thought about it, right? And I spoke about culture\\njust a few minutes ago. Remember one of his choices\\nfrom the culture element is he wants to make sure that the outbound emails are screened. You may argue that that\\'s\\na technical control, but that\\'s also a control\\nof how the operation of the fabric, rather the fabric of\\nthe company\\'s culture, wants to be built, right? He may choose not to screen depending on the customer\\'s\\ncontract, et cetera. But in this case, he makes\\nthe choice to screen. He also makes the choice\\nthat multifactor is required but not for all, right? He wants his business user to go ahead and access the website\\nwhichever fashion they want. Like you may be using your\\npublic available web mails today. But for his IT staff, he wanted a step up, he wanted a certain degree of\\nhigher assurance of controls. And he chose not to go\\nwith his digital rights. Remember? And these were the two elements that will not happen if\\nhe doesn\\'t choose this. So that\\'s a conscious decision he\\'s making in the context of\\nimplementing those controls. And when you\\'re looking at application, the larger part of the behavior, you know, you don\\'t want your\\ncustomer to see a 404 page, page not found, right? You wanna make sure\\nthat all the exceptions, all the input validation,\\nall the attack vectors that are, let\\'s say, on the\\nSQL injection side, et cetera, handled well. Most of them, if you\\ncover by input validation, you\\'re kind of likely to\\nbe more safe than sorry. So that\\'s the piece that he focuses on. All right. You\\'ve chosen the controls. You\\'ve implemented the configuration. Now\\'s the time to test. How many of you drive the car here, right? All of you, I guess. Once you\\'ve passed the test, you would at some point\\nwant to make sure that, or once you\\'ve taken the exam and you, at some point, want to make sure that you are really driving it well. That\\'s where your DMV comes in, I guess. The validation part therefore looks at: Is the stated objective\\nbeing met or not met? So we\\'ll see some of those examples. Here it\\'s important to think about what is it that\\nwe are going to test? What is the real exposure going to be? What is the customer or the regulator actually\\ninfluencing that decision with? Are there any certifications\\nthat are impacted with the choices we\\'ve made? Again, the capacity question, right? There are going to be, for example, the CIS and the NIST for example, have thousands of controls. I\\'m gonna be able to\\ntest all the thousands at a certain periodicity. The answer is going to be no with automation, without automation. And then there are\\nother elements of, okay, there could be some element\\nof where the posture, where the element of configuration can be automatically\\ndetermined, external surface, what have you, and what do they tell you. But then it is important to make sure that all of the assimilation\\nof the choices you\\'ve made, the controlled success of failure\\nis appropriately reported. If any of you\\'re familiar\\nwith the PDCA cycle, that\\'s what this is\\nkind of going to, right? Now remember, it\\'s important\\nthat these results are consumed by the other teams\\nwithin the organization, whether it is IT, threat intel,\\nor the defense mechanisms. Otherwise, you\\'ll have a control that may work or may not work, but the other hand does not know how the whole thing comes together. So that\\'s important. Now having talked about it, what do we measure then, right? We\\'ve so spoken about validation, but then validation\\nthrows out some numbers, validation throws out some measures. But how do we bring about the\\nstory to be like numerically or presented to the right\\nlayers of management? So you could go with any of these. They are just an example,\\nsets of examples. You could go as deep as behaviors, determining behaviors\\nand talking through it. But then some of it are more obvious like how many accounts have MFA or don\\'t, how many accounts have privilege or don\\'t, and so on so forth. And like we said, if you\\nremember the top bar there, they were the same\\ndomains we chose earlier on the slide three or four, right? Now in my mind, Metrics 101 is all about\\nmaking sure it\\'s relevant to the audience. The so-what should be more focused on, and that\\'s where the\\njourney will come from. It needs to connect to\\na business objective. The objective that Rama had to make sure that his website has a\\ncertain amount of reach, a certain amount of\\nrevenue coming out from it. That\\'s the central focus\\nof how the objective needs to be met with the controls he\\'s chosen and therefore the performance\\nof that controlled mechanism is how the objective will be met. Now there are other\\nthings that I call 3Cs, which is clear, consistent, and concise. The metric needs to be repeatable\\nfrom the same set of data, otherwise it\\'s not liable. The metric needs to be arriving at the same inference, right? If two people look at\\nthe same sets of data, the presentation layer may change, but the analysis should\\nnot ideally change. And again, I personally believe that this is a pretty important\\nelement of formatting. The element of how the data\\nis presented is important. Think for yourself. When you go and buy an Apple product in a very well lit,\\nwide, beautiful showroom versus a mom and pop shop\\nsomewhere down the street with some other brand of the phone, which one are you likely to choose given that you may have the\\nsame amount of money, right? The chances are that you\\'ll\\ngravitate to a better brand. And that presentation is important. And again, I don\\'t work for Apple. And then like I said, business objective and therefore the outcome driven. So they\\'re like corresponding\\nlayers of the metric. Now think about all of\\nthis will generate hundreds and tens and gigs of data. It\\'ll also generate a lot of\\nvalue that has to be told, the story has to come out. But everybody thinks about\\nthat number differently, right? If you talk about the\\nlayer in the management, the strategic layer\\nwants to look at a data in a different set. The tactical layer or the\\nmid-management wants to look at it with a different layer of lens, and the operational guy\\nneeds far more detail, two hands and keyboard\\nto work on it, right? What I\\'ve tried to depict is the ladder because you go up and down the choice, and then remember that\\nthe details on metric largely are more as you grow up that go on the right of the ladder, which is you have tactical\\nand the operational layers. And if you go strategic, it\\'s very, very unlikely that\\nyou\\'ll need too much detail. There may be some detail-oriented\\nsenior management folks as well, but then it\\'s easier\\nto build that story there. In my view, here are some examples. Right? Like I said, the CxO layer\\nlooks at the big picture, the mid-management plans about, \"Okay, here are the problems to fix, here\\'s what the metric is telling\\nme, what do I need to do?\" And then the practitioner\\nactually goes about doing so. And again, in my opinion, these\\nare five dimensions I chose to bring to the management layer where our desired control is, which is in the dark blue line, and where our current status is because the controls may have not worked as optimally as you want based\\noff cost, based off capacity, or even time, right? For example, I\\'m assuming people here know that you can really patch every machine every single time a patch\\ncomes out, isn\\'t it? The answer is no. And that gap could be\\na function here, right? Alright, the mid-management layer may want to know a little bit\\nmore than this pythogram. I favor this pythograph. I like that representation. But the bar graph will tell you, hey, when I examine the\\ncontrol on this app or that app or these APIs, here are the three or four\\ncontrol gaps that we found. Here is the depth of issues that we found that may not have been sufficient, right? So this information is then consumed in a much more detail by the next layer, which is the tactical layer, sorry, the operational layer. Here if you see, it has far more detail than\\nalso the choices to be made. For example, in this case, the application to where the\\ncontrols were validated, tested is going to be decommissioned\\nin a certain timeframe. Therefore some of these\\ncontrols are not going to be remediated. That\\'s an information the\\npractitioner needs to know because he doesn\\'t need to spend or she doesn\\'t need to spend time on that. And that\\'s where the magic comes from in terms of prioritization as well. Okay. Now let\\'s go back to having tested, some action has already been generated. Some refinements will\\nhave to happen, right? Some controlled tweak, configuration element\\ntweak will have to happen. So here\\'s what influences\\nsome of those tweaks. Metrics like what we just spoke of, security incidents, external breathing. We come to forums such as this, know about lots of things, AI included, and that can influence what\\nyour refinement should be. I\\'m sure many of you have\\nattended several sessions, keynotes, et cetera, and have taken some learning to take back to your organization. And that will also trigger\\nsome of these refinements. You may also look through\\nyour historical issues, historical risks, and then try to tweak based\\non the current capacity, capability and cost. And then the technology changes. Now everybody in under this\\nplanet today talks about AI, right? So that change is going to trigger some refinements\\nsomewhere in your ecosystem. And finally, some of those\\nthreat intelligence feeds, like the way your attack vector or your threat actors are\\nacting in your area of work, or your vertical or your businesses will\\ntrigger some more action. And that\\'s the piece\\nthat I believe can lead to more refinements. That refinement that you\\'ve chosen now will also have to be implemented. So it\\'s almost like a cyclical process. But think about it this way, as well. When you refine a control, there may be a situation where you are upping some\\nof the controls requirements and therefore you\\'re able to reduce some of the control requirements. Think about it this way, the example I have for you is, let\\'s say you have your password set to be about 10 characters today. And let\\'s say you increase that to 14. Once you do that, you may have an option based\\noff all historical trends, threat intel, what have you, that you don\\'t necessarily need to change the password\\nevery 90 days, isn\\'t it? You may choose to do so 180 days or maybe, I don\\'t know, 365 days. So that\\'s the piece of refinement that you have to consciously think about that the refinement may\\nmean increasing or reducing. When I say reducing, I don\\'t\\nmean the efficacy of it, I only mean the depth of it or the level of it in that sense, right? Because there are enough\\ncompensating controls in the ecosystem to bring that about. All right, so let\\'s now map it\\nto Rama\\'s areas of controls. So remember he chose these and he chose threat intel\\nnot to be implemented, but based on the input he\\ngot from his threat intel, he now decides to refine them with, including a DRP product and onboarding it for at least his execs and then go forward with some of the other code repositories. Because remember, he\\'s\\na guy who builds code, builds applications. So some of those newly added\\ncontrols are basically going to add to his control\\nrepository hereafter. Here for you is the whole story that I was trying to weave\\nin whatever last 20 minutes. This is the lifecycle and that\\'s the repository of\\ncontrols that you can consider. That\\'s, again, not a finite picture. You can have more, but\\nI\\'d like you to make sure that you remember these three Cs: capability, capacity, and cost. They will always be probably\\nthe influencing factor of what your choices are. They\\'re also going to\\nbe influenced by your, I\\'m saying upbringing\\nin a very loose term, essentially your\\ncircumstances, your choices of the environment that\\nyou may have experienced. All right. Almost at the end. AI, as you can imagine, will disrupt. There are some methods that\\nI think it may disrupt with, but then there are far\\nmore experts in this room and in the buildings that would\\'ve already spoken\\nmillion times about AI and how are they gonna disrupt. So think about those assimilations for you and how those will drive the refinements in your areas of work. So that broadly is my positioning of what one our controls is. And here\\'s what I think you can take back. For you to make sure that\\nyou\\'re making the right choices, focus on what your capabilities, what your capacities, and what your cost lever is. There is not going to be a finite answer. It\\'s not, if many of you may be from the\\nsecurity consulting business, right? There\\'s a very common\\nphrase that consultants use. Ask me a question. It may start with, well it depends. And that\\'s what this is at, right? So there\\'s not gonna be a finite answer to what controls should I choose? Well, I don\\'t know. It depends. The control library, there\\'s an example of it, like the CISs repository. You can choose to use that. It has a pretty detailed one. There are other standards as well. I was listening to a\\nsession earlier today. There is apparently an open source forum where some of these standards\\nare already correlated. So you can leverage that. You also need to be very cognizant and very conscious about\\nthe level you are at and where you want to be, the desired and the current level, right? And therefore figure out\\nwhat delta you need to do to refine your control environment\\nand go forward from it. There is another framework\\nfrom NIST called the OSCAL. It basically allows the assessment and the control to kind\\nof talk to each other, basically using JSON and such. And that I believe will help you automate and do a lot of these\\ncontrol validation exercises much, much faster and more reliably. Weeding out the manual effort there. In my mind, this will probably take you about six to nine months. I don\\'t have a breakup by\\nthree months to nine months. Guess why? Because it depends. It\\'s your choice. It\\'s your organization. I can\\'t dictate that. But those choices are available. However, the final piece that I\\'d like to share\\nwith you is oftentimes, and I\\'ve seen it enough in my life, that we forget the foundation. We forget the basic layers of controls. If you read up on any of these advisories and any of these\\ninformation that\\'s available on what the attack vector is doing, threat actors are doing, nine out of 10 times, I bet you, it will be either a weak configuration that was supposed to be\\nfixed before I was born and/or weak passwords, right? Of course these are just two examples, but largely people forget the basics. If you don\\'t remember your A, B, C, D, it\\'s unlikely that you\\'ll make a sentence. That will be relevant for long term. So that\\'s the piece that\\nI\\'d like to leave you with and open it with questions. I think I\\'m super ahead of time, but... Questions please. I don\\'t want you to miss Alicia\\'s... I\\'m just saying. Please. - One... Hello? Yeah. One thing that I think we end\\nup doing in the industry is that we implement controls\\nbut we don\\'t retire them. I mean I understand that refinement, it\\'s like you put more\\nmoney or less money, but the retirement of controls. I think it\\'s very-\\n- Retirement of controls? - Yeah.\\n- Yeah, okay. - It\\'s very hard-\\n- So if you notice that if I... You said retirement, right? - Yes.\\n- Yeah. - I think it\\'s very hard for human beings to get rid of stuff.\\n- Agree. - Yeah, so... - So I bundled it in\\nrefinements as an example. The idea was that when the environments are\\nsupposed to be decommissioned, for me it was a function of refinement because when you lessen\\nthe attack surface, remove the control requirement, that\\'s a refinement\\nfor me, but fair point. I mean, we can elaborate on that as well. Thank you. Okay. Yes, please. - Hi. So in your example up there, there was basically one product that was being, you know, controls were being established for. Say in an organization, there\\'s several different\\nproducts, different teams. Is there, do you see risk in trying to establish kind of a\\norganization wide set of controls? - Yes.\\n- And what could those be? - Thank you for your question. But think about it like this. If you remember my bubble chart where there was a lot of controls and that intersection was depicted, think about that intersection\\nto be your finite list of controls for the organization. Most often, right? And then there will be a delta app. For example, you want to\\ndo something more special for your AWS or for any\\nof your cloud presence and therefore you want to\\nmake it more stringent. Think about them as bolt-ons\\nto your control library, applicable to a scope that is beyond the larger part of the enterprise ones, right? And that is definitely possible and that\\'s something you should do. But then again, the\\nscoping question is again, a function of capacity\\nand capability, right? And that\\'s the reason I\\nwas trying to connect it to the capability and capacity. Because if you, like the example of multifactor, right, Rama didn\\'t choose to implement\\nmultifactor for everyone. It was for a business purpose, but it is also for a reason\\nof cost maybe in that fashion. I hope that answers. - Thanks. - Cool. I don\\'t have swags to\\ngive every few questions. Alright, I think that\\'s it. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time.

My name's Ben Schmerler. I just did the talk a little bit ago about toilet hacking. I work with ISC. You wanna talk to me more, I'm over there. But today, or for this last session, I'm introducing Lenin Alevski at Google and Max vonBlankenburg. We are gonna talk about\\nsome security stuff, so please welcome to the stage. (upbeat music) - Hello. Hello everybody.\\nThank you so much for coming. My name is Lenin Alevski. I'm\\na security engineer at Google. I'm also a volunteer at\\nPacific Hacker Association. - And I'm Max vonBlankenburg. I'm a security researcher at Semgrep and another volunteer at Pacific Hackers. - So before we start,\\nthe usual disclaimer, the opinions expressed\\nhere are not the opinions of our employers or this organization. So with all that say, this is the agenda for today. We're gonna start with\\na quick introduction on what are containers and\\ncontainers technologies, what the hell is Kubernetes,\\nthe Kubernetes threat model. Then we are gonna talk about the most common attack techniques,\\nsome build-in defences, and finally the Kubernetes evolution. So probably if you are here, you are concerned about\\nprocess isolation, right? Application compartmentalization. So at the beginning, this was a simple problem to solve, right? In the traditional architecture, it's a straightforward as\\nputting one process per machine. But what this is a\\nstraightforward solution, this is not cost effective. Then we have the virtual\\nmachine architecture where we have a special component, which is called the\\nhypervisor, which is capable of virtualize an entire operating system, offering some degree of isolation. However, this still is a problem because virtual machines tend to be big and you cannot move them. Finally, we reach out the\\ncontainer architecture where we have a component\\ncalled the container runtime that is capable of running\\nwhat is called a container. A container is a special\\nformat for your application that is packaged without its\\nsource code, configuration and dependencies, and it's able to run as if it's running in its\\nown separated hardware. While this is cost effective and performance improved\\nis not a silver bullet, and we're gonna explain why. So I mentioned the word container\\na couple of times already, but what if I tell you\\nthere is no container, in reality is just another\\nprocess running on your machine. So yeah, what containers really are? So in reality, containers are a very clever\\noperating system virtualization that use some of the\\nfeatures of the kernel to offer some degree of isolation. Those features will be name spaces, which basically control\\nwhat a process can see. Cgroups short for control groups, they are very useful to\\nassign different resources in term of network\\nthroughput, CPU, memory, and finally, capabilities which control the level of privilege a\\nprocess can have in your system. Next Max is gonna talk more\\nabout what is Kubernetes. - Thanks Lenin. So we talked a little bit\\nabout what containers are. Now let's explain what Kubernetes is. You can probably think of Kubernetes. If Docker is a shipping container, then Kubernetes would be the fleet of cargo ships running them. It's an orchestration tool, a framework for building distributed systems, an alternative way that you\\ncan deploy your applications. In general, it can be deter, called the operating\\nsystem of the internet, as many containers as you\\nwant at lightning speed. In this talk, there's\\ngoing to be a lot of terms we're going to throw around, so I'm going to define\\nsome of them real quick. First and foremost, services in Kubernetes refer to the way Kubernetes allows users to access your applications. These are the public IP address in pod. A pod is a group of containers that are deployed together. These share network namespace, and can also share file system namespace. A node refers to the\\nvirtual machine that's used to run containers and pods themselves. And a node cluster is\\nwhat forms the backbone of a Kubernetes application in general. Containers are grouped into pods, which are allocated and run on nodes inside of a Kubernetes cluster. And finally, we have a deployment, which is the set of configuration values that define a cluster, describes how your pods\\nare allocated and managed. Breaking it down a little bit further, this is kind of what a Kubernetes application\\nlooks under the hood. On the front you have plane service, which is all your user sees, but behind that service\\nis any number of nodes running any number of pods, running any number of containers each. Breaking it a little down further, we'll get into the Kubernetes components. There are control playing components which are unique to a cluster. These include the kube-apiserver which is the main control playing for the Kubernetes cluster. There's etcd, which is used\\nfor data storage, config, maps, secrets, et cetera. The kube-scheduler, which\\nschedules newly created pause to be run on nodes and the kube-controller, which monitors and manages those pauses to make sure they're running correctly according to your deployment. And unique to every single\\nnode is node components. These include the kube-proxy,\\nwhich is the interface between the node and the kube-apiserver. The kubelet which is the\\ncontrol agent for a node. It's communicates with the API server and oh, I'm sorry, I'm incorrect. Kube-proxy proxies network\\ntraffic between the node and the service. The kubelet is what interfaces\\nwith the kube-apiserver and controls your node. And finally, there's a\\ncontainer runtime like docker, which runs containers on the node. With this model of Kubernetes,\\nwe also have a threat model. Of course, if an attacker\\ncontrol container or a pod, they control the application and they may be able to\\nescape and attack the node. If they control the kubelet on a node, they control all the pods\\nrunning on said node. If they control the worker nodes, they control all the\\npods running on said node and can also escalate privileges\\nto attack the master nodes. And if they gain access to the master or the control plane nodes,\\nthey control the entire cluster. They can add, modify, delete everything. So with new threat models come new risks and new OWASP lists. Here's the Kubernetes OWASP top 10 lists. And moving forward, Lenin will tell us about the Kubernetes most\\ncommon attack techniques. - Thank you Max. So Kubernetes\\ncommon attack techniques. in 2021, 2020 researchers\\nof Microsoft put together a threat matrix like the Mitre Attack that consolidates all\\nthe different tactics and procedures that affect\\ncontainer environments. So this matrix is very similar to your traditional Linux systems, but at the same time, it's different. For example, initial access to the machine becomes\\ninitial access to the cluster, or running malicious code on the machine becomes running malicious\\ncode on the cluster or the container. One year after that, the Microsoft researcher\\nupdate this matrix and also with the help of\\nindependent researcher, they add additional tactics and techniques and procedure they observe\\non the (indistinct) and they also remove some other that they were not relevant anymore. So in this talk, we're gonna mention into\\nwhich each one of those. So initial access, the initial access phase\\nwill be all the tactics that techniques that attackers and adversaries will use to put one foot in the cluster. This may include things like\\nusing cloud credentials, compromise registries, the\\nkubeconfig file, and so on. For example, when it comes\\nto using cloud credentials, attacker may prefer to use\\ntraditional phishing techniques to steal access to your\\nfavorite cloud providers that allow them to get access\\nto a UI, a management UI to a console to control\\na Kubernetes cluster instead of the attacking\\ndirectly the cluster. So this is still effective and even in a scenario when providers often multifactor authentication, they are able to trick them with technique like MFA bombing and so on. Next in the list is sometimes an attacker will prefer to compromise\\ncontainer registries. So container registries will\\ncontain a list of images and if an attacker is able to\\npush their a malicious image or a malicious dependency,\\nso raise their hand, who here has to deal with\\nthe exact vulnerability. So this is a good example\\nof supply chain attacks in which containers didn't\\ndirectly attack the cluster, but they were able to backdoor\\none of the dependencies which end running inside\\nan image in the cluster. So the next release will be\\nhunting for kubeconfig files. So the kubeconfig file is very important because it gives you, it contains the credentials\\nto connect to a cluster. So in this example, I did\\na very simple GitHub search and you can see by searching\\nfor this simple term, you are able to get credentials and you may try to use\\nthese credentials to connect to a cluster random link on the internet. So this works particularly well for attackers if they get their hands on some developers machine\\nand then they will have basically the same level of privilege that the developer will have. Next in the lead we have\\napplication vulnerabilities. So at the end of the day, we are running web\\napplications in our clusters. So if those web\\napplications are vulnerable to common vulnerabilities\\nlike remote code execution or SQL injection, that will be an entry\\npoint into our clusters. These vulnerabilities\\nsite are commonly covered by OWASP top 10 and many\\nother documentation. And finally we have exposed\\nsensitive interface. This one is very, it's funny for me because at the beginning, by\\ndefault the kube-apiserver came with its own UI and that UI was commonly\\nexposed to the internet. At some point, Kubernete\\ndevelopers fix that. But several projects now they include their own management UIs and sometimes they are\\nexposing to the internet with default credentials or\\nnot any protection at all. So if an attacker is able\\nto find one of these, that's an entry point to the cluster. So next Max is gonna talk\\nabout the execution phase. - Thanks Lenin. So moving\\nforward to execution, we have many techniques used by attackers to run their code inside of cluster. It allows an attacker to gain a foothold for further exploitation. Okay, yeah. So first on the\\nlist is the application exploit and Lenin mentioned that a little bit. If there's a vulnerable\\napplication running a container that can be exploited to\\ngain access to the container and run your code inside of it. And the other three are\\nmore unique to Kubernetes, I'll explain them in a little more. That's back my bad. Yes, attackers can run\\nexec inside containers. If an attacker gains access\\nto account credentials and they can access the\\nKubernetes API server, they can run Kubectl exec and exec their code on\\na running container. That's one example. But in some cases, attackers can't exec\\ninto specific containers. For example, if it's a scratch container. In these cases, attackers can simply\\nrun their own containers on the cluster and\\ndeploy them from scratch. This is a common way that crypto miners are\\ndeployed in clusters. And if an attacker wants\\nto be especially sneaky, they can deploy sidecar\\ncontainer inside an existing pod. Usually pods have one main\\ncontainer that they have running, but they can have any number\\nof sidecar containers as well. So putting another container\\ninside an existing pod can hide it from monitoring\\ntools and the like. After execution, we have persistence. I believe you're covering, no, I'm covering that. No, excuse me. Yes. In persistence, we have tactics used to maintain the initial foothold held by the attacker after exploitation. Lemme see, we've got a\\nbasic backdoor container. As mentioned before, attackers can deploy their own containers to execute code in the cluster. This can be used to maintain persistence because it's a backdoor\\nand it will keep running. You can also use Kubernetes CronJob. Kubernetes job is a specific\\nimplementation in Kubernetes that allows specific containers that are meant to run specific jobs to run its specific times. it's like CronJob on a Linux\\nmachine or any other machine. So it spins up a, you can spin up a malicious\\ncontainer at any time to run a job and then it spins down, harder to detect. Some more obscure techniques include a writeable hostpath mount. If an attacker is able to\\ncreate a new container, they may be able to create it with a writeable hostpath mount as well. This means that the container\\nhas right access to the host, the node running the container. And this, as you can imagine, is very bad because then\\nthe attacker can do, can write whatever they want on the host, they can write to the authorized key file\\nand add their own SSH key. They can add a CronJob, et cetera. Finally, we have the malicious\\nadmission controller. The admission controller\\nis a Kubernetes tool that looks at deployments\\ncoming into the cluster and reads and optionally modifies them. It's an audit tool. If an\\nattacker takes this over, they can leverage it to inject a malicious container into a valid workload. Here we have a legitimate user. The attacker adds their\\ncontainer to the workload and Kubernetes deploys it as if it's a legitimate container. Now Lenin, we'll talk\\nabout privilege escalation. - Thank you Max. Oh, moving on. Privileged escalation techniques\\nwill be all the tactics and techniques really\\nthe adversary will do to move forward in their attack chain. For example, if they compromise\\na regular application, they will try to break out\\ninto the host system, right? If they are already at the host system, they will try to move to different nodes. If they are moved to different node, they will try to\\ncompromise a control plane. They can do this by many different ways. Max already talk about hostpath mounts. Another way is compromising\\nadditional cloud resources. For example, let's say an\\nattacker compromise a container and that had access to\\na cloud bucket like S3, or even a credential for an\\nidentity provider, so on. But let's take a second to appreciate this 280 character tweets that will compromise\\nyour Kubernetes cluster. You can take a picture,\\nyou may want to try to run this in your cluster\\nand see what happens. But really what this command is doing, is creating what is called\\na privileged container. So a privileged container\\nin reality is a process that has access to all\\nthe hostPID namespace, process namespace, has access to all the network\\nnamespace of the machine, so it can see everything that is connected to the sockets and it has access to all the files in the system. A malicious attacker can do\\nthat with that simple command. So in this example, they achieve that by getting some cluster credentials or compromising a Kubernetes\\nmanagement console. They deploy that on a particular machine and then it's equivalent of the controlling the whole machine. But sometimes privileged containers are already running in the cluster. This is the case for a very old privilege that used to exist in Kubernetes by default calling the name\\nthe cluster-admin role. So the cluster-admin role\\nwill be the equivalent of a super user on a\\ntraditional Linux system. So if an attacker is able\\nto compromise a container that has this token inside has this particular role assigned, it may be trying to escalate privilege to deploy additional malicious workloads such as crypto miners, or really reading every secret from the at (indistinct) NoSQL store. So moving on, Max is gonna talk more\\nabout defense evasions. - Thank you. So defense\\nevasion consists of tactics used by attackers to avoid detection and hide their activity, basic. So one of the first techniques here is clearing container logs. This is just the application\\nrunning at the container is generating application logs. You can clear these, you can clear the engine\\nX logs, et cetera. There's also Kubernetes events, Kubernetes events track any changes that happen in the\\ncluster inside Kubernetes. These can be deleted using\\nKubectl, delete events, all, to hide their cluster activity. They can also use something\\nsimilar to typo squatting, naming their malicious pods or containers similar to valid pods. This makes it easier\\nto hide malicious pods and maintainers might not recognize that their cluster has been\\ncompromised this way. There's also connecting\\nfrom a proxy server, which is connecting from a VPN or if an attacker leverages access inside the Kubernetes network, they can deploy their attacks\\nfrom inside the network. The call is coming from in\\nwithin the house type of thing. Basic, yeah, you get the idea. Moving on to credential access. There are a lot of credentials that could be found in\\nKubernetes clusters. This consists of techniques\\nused by attackers to obtain these credentials. They can of course list Kubernetes secrets with a simple Kubernetes command. Kubernetes has built in secrets. There's service principle credentials which are cloud credentials. These can usually, attackers can usually leverage\\ntheir access to containers to access service principle credentials. In this case, they actually\\nusually have to access a node. We forward, there's a container\\nservice account credentials by default, service accounts are created\\nfor every pod in cluster. So an attacker, if an attacker is able\\nto steal the credentials for that service account, they're able to perform\\nactions on the pod. There's a very common one, application credentials\\nin configuration files. These are in your deployments credentials. If you don't deploy your\\ncredentials in secrets, you may put them directly into the deployment configuration files. This is a very bad idea. We have some mitigations\\nfor that later in the talk. Please don't do this if you have the, if you have the ability to, it makes it very easy to steal. There's also managed identity credentials, which are another form\\nof cloud credentials. These can usually be queried if an attacker takes over container. That can query it and use it to gain information\\nabout cloud resources such as the underlying node. And finally, the admission\\ncontroller, if taken over, can be used to read\\ndeployments, deployed workloads, and these can have sensitive\\ninformation in them as well. Moving forward, the discovery technique allows attackers to enumerate their environments,\\nperform lateral movements, and there's many ways they can do this. Of course, they can access\\nthe Kubernetes API server, which controls the entire cluster. So you can gain information about the whole cluster this way. And if they don't have access\\nto the Kubernetes API server, they can access the kubelet API. the kubelet API is by default, or the kubelet itself by\\ndefault exposes a read only API that does not require authentication, which is usually a lot easier to access than the Kubernetes API server. This can be used to\\nread information about, I believe the running\\npods and the node itself. They can also map the Kubernetes network as usual using tools like NPM. By default, containers and pods don't have any restriction on who can, pods have. Sorry. By default pods have no restriction on which pods can communicate with which. So if an attacker controls one container, they can query the whole cluster, map the whole network. Let's you put in network policies, which we'll get into later. They can also access\\nthe Kubernetes dashboard to view information in the web UI and they may be able to access\\nan instance metadata API. This is a cloud API, attackers that gain access to a container may be able to query this API in order to gain information\\nabout the underlying node, which is dangerous of course. Moving forward, Lenin, can you tell us about lateral movement? - Yeah, we have a lot\\nmore content to cover, so I'm gonna move fast. So yeah, lateral movement, this will be tactics and techniques that attacker will use to traverse or cluster or traverse\\ndifferent environment like multi cloud environments, different machines,\\ndifferent privileged pods. So to do the attacker may leverage access to closed resources as I mentioned. Let's say an attacker\\ncompromise a container. There is some privileged credentials to access some cloud resource on a cloud. They may try to steal\\ncontainer service account. So service accounts in\\nKubernetes is the main way they assign identities to\\nthe different workloads. So in case they compromise\\na privileged identity, they can use that to pretty\\nmuch impersonate the workload and the cluster. Max already mentioned the\\nlack of network segmentation. So an attacker may try to\\nuse regular networking tools like Nmap to scan the whole cluster. Containers may include\\napplication credentials in configuration files such\\nas service account, tokens, database credentials and so on. They may also try to exploit\\ngradable volume mounts on the host. And finally they may try\\nto do CoreDNS poisoning, which CoreDNS in Kubernetes is one of the main mechanism\\nthey do DNS resolution. So if an attacker is able\\nto compromise CoreDNS, it can impersonate the process. So moving on, we have collection with, I already mentioned a\\nlittle bit at the beginning, so sometimes attackers, for attackers is easier to try\\nto target docker registries or container registries. But sometimes if they are\\nalready in the cluster, let's say your organization\\nhas its own private registry to access that private\\nregistry and pull credentials, you need some time of put container, you need some type of credentials. Attacker can steal that and then they can pull any\\ncontainer image they may want. And sometimes container images may contain credentials inside, right? So that's another way they\\ncan do to achieve collection. And finally, let's talk about the impact. So the impact is very simple.\\nIt may be data destruction. It may be as easy as\\nremoving persistent volumes that doesn't have a, like\\na log to don't be removed. They can also delete logs or events. So in case of an investigation, you cannot, it difficult effort. They may do resource hijacking by deploying their own crypto miners, their own tolerance server\\nor basically abusing CPU and memory resources of your clusters. And they may cause a denial\\nof service by deleting pods, deployments, StatefulSet, services and ingress controllers. So I think that's enough\\nof bad things. So Max. - Alright, let's talk\\nabout some good things. So what do we do about all this? Oh, wrong button. Yes. There's many different\\nmitigations you can put in place to deal with these attack techniques. First and foremost,\\nwe're going to talk about some container restrictions\\nyou can put in place to harden your containers. This is a very basic one.\\nResource quotas and limits. You can limit the amount of resources each\\ncontainer's allowed to use. The most common is limits on\\nCPU and memory, et cetera. In Kubernetes, the resource\\nrequest configuration tells the kubelet how\\nmany resources to reserve for a given container. And the resource limit says\\nthis container's not allowed to use any more than the given resource. It's the lower limit and the upper limit. The kubelet in charge of\\nenforcing these values is a very simple way to\\nprevent crypto miners. That's that. There's\\nalso security contexts that you can implement in pods. And these go into lots of detail. There's many security contests, I'll just mention a few. Privilege and access control, allow privilege escalation\\ndefines whether processes in a given container\\ncan gain more privileges than their parent process. Privileged defines whether this is a privilege container or not. Alevski mission that a little earlier. Privilege containers are equivalent to root processes on the host, runAsNonRoot, runAsUser, runAsGroup, control what users the processes run as. There's capabilities management. If you don't want to\\ngive full root privileges to a specific container, you can give them specific\\ncapabilities of root, but not the entirety of it. These can be configured\\nin security context. You can set file system in mount settings such as setting file system, be read only. You typically want to do this by default unless you're writing to the system. And you can set security profiles, like security enhanced\\nLinux, set comp, et cetera. Moving on past the container, you can set up network policies\\nand these are very powerful. We mentioned that pods by default have no\\nrestriction on the traffic allowed to communicate between each other. Network policies allow\\nyou to restrict that, they control who can talk to who. These are implemented\\nby the network plugin or the CNI to use these, the CNI needs to support network policies. Kubenet is the default CNI. But some other popular ones\\nare Flannel, Calico, Cilium and Istio, choose whichever works for you. Now these are really cool. Pods are not isolated by default. But once there's a network policy in place in namespace selecting a particular pod, that pod will reject\\nconnections from everywhere that don't abide by the network policy. In this example here we\\nhave a network policy that is selecting all\\npause with the role db. And in this we can enforce\\nboth ingress traffic and egress traffic. We have a policy that only accepts traffic from the namespace. I believe the project, my project is what it's doing here. Namespace selector for\\nproject, my project, it only accepts traffic from my project. It only accepts traffic from\\npods with the roll front end up at the top here. And it also only accepts traffic from pods that have the IP address\\nin that specific IP range. I won't spell that out\\nfor you for sake of time. And you can also enforce egress. This pod is only allowed to communicate to IP address blocks 10.0.0.0 slash 24. Moving on from network,\\nwe get to encryption. There's two things you\\nneed to look out for. Encryption and transit\\nand encryption at rest. By default network traffic and\\nKubernetes is non-encrypted. But you can very easily\\nencrypt it by setting up, setting up a TLS certificates. That's it. The API to do this is certificates.k8s.io. You can query this to\\ncreate your own certificates or you can use a external certificate manager\\nsuch as cert-manager.io. Some network CI plugins also\\nsupport this by default, use whatever works for you. And for encryption at rest you can use encryption configuration. This enables at risk encryption\\nfor secrets, config maps, any sort of data in\\nyour Kubernetes cluster, it supports AESCBC, AESGCM, is somewhat limited, but you can also implement a\\nexternal key management system, which is much more secure and works to, it works on the exact same thing. Quick note is that you cannot use this to encrypt file systems. To do that, you need a different solution, either encrypting the data\\nwith your own application or using a storage integration that provides encrypted volumes. Now Lenin, could you tell us\\nabout cloud security policies. - Thank you, Max. So now let's talk about access control. So when it comes to access control and follow the principle\\nof less privilege, Kubernetes has several options. So the old one, this is deprecated, but I'm gonna talk about because I still see a\\nlot of all cluster that use this version is called\\npod security policies. So at a very high level,\\npod security policies allow you to define certain rules that you have the roles and\\nrole bindings on the left. And they are network,\\nthey are namespace scope. They will allow you to define\\na certain level of privilege and access to resources that a particular identity\\nmay have in your cluster. On the right side, you have cluster role and cluster role binding,\\nwhich are exactly the same, but they are not scoped\\na particular namespace. So let's say you want\\nto protect your cluster from the example of the privileged pod, or the privileged container. The first thing you have to do will be create a pod security policy. In this case, it is a restrictive policy because it will enforce\\ncertain configuration that is gonna be secure by default, such as hostPID equal false. Network equal false, and so on. Then you have to create a cluster role. So this will be a policy that\\nwill affect the whole cluster. With the cluster role. you will mention your PodSecurityPolicy and it's very important. You will say verb equal use. And then finally you use\\na cluster role binding, which is gonna put everything\\ntogether, the identity, or the group or the service\\naccount and your policy. So if you want to visualize that, it will look a little bit like a tree, like a tree structure in which the cluster role binding is at the top. Then you have your cluster role that is associated with the policy. And on the other side, you have\\nyour identity, or your group or your user. So the next time somebody try to deploy a privileged\\ncontainer into your cluster, first of all it's gonna get an error and Kubernetes is gonna\\nprevent that workload to run. So this is a cool way to do it. But a most modern approach will be a pod security admission. So a pod security admission\\nis a feature in Kubernetes that helps you ensure your pod met certain security guidelines before they are allowed to run. Think of it as a security checkpoint that a pod has to pass through. Imagine a gatekeeper for\\nyour Kubernetes cluster. And before any request,\\nfor example, creating a pod or a service, or really any\\nother resource in the cluster is fully processed, it has to go through a\\ngatekeeper or a checkpoint. The admission controller\\nare that checkpoint and by itself, it's gonna allow you to prevent malicious deployments, or really prevent any misconfiguration that you won't like in your cluster. So here are a couple of\\nexample, like OPA Gatekeeper, Kynerno, jsPolicy. Each one of that has advantages\\nand its disadvantage. So really use whatever works for you. Next, moving on, we have audit log. So by default Kubernetes\\nhas an audit log mechanism, which is very flexible. So once you enable it, it's going to start logging\\nevery operation in the cluster. You can tune it and configure\\nto meet your standards such as only log particular operations, like creating pods, creating services, creating StatefulSet. You can decide if you want to write these logs into your file system, or send it to like a SIM solution, or like any other third\\nparty log analyzer. But there is a catch, right? There is a thing that\\nyou have to consider, like enable audit log, will consume additional\\nresources in your cluster because for every new request\\ninto the kube-apiserver, there has to be some processing that will consume CPU and memory. Next, finally, we have hardening the\\nkubelet component itself. So for doing that, you\\nhave several options. One option is to isolate\\nyour Kubernetes node, which basically mean don't expose them directly into the internet. Instead, use an English controller and try to separate no traffic. For example, if your machine support different network interfaces, you can have one network interface for public traffic like HTTP connection to your own applications, while you have a separate\\nnetwork interface that handles internet communication, or really use management\\ncommunication to your API cluster. Next in the list will be\\nprotect your kubelet process. Max already talk about that, but really is disabled\\nanonymous authentication and instead enable MTLS\\nauthentication for the API. Another thing you can do is\\nenable TLS for a (indistinct) which is the NoSQL key store that is gonna handle all the config maps and secrets for your cluster. So you can put a firewall in front, you can enable encryption address, you can use a KMS to encrypt the data. And finally, you can use\\nthird party authentication for your API server. So this means putting in\\nfront OIDC, open IDC connect, or really building your own\\ncustom proxy for authentication. So what's next? So we are still facing\\nmany security challenges when it comes to defending Kubernetes. It is become increasingly popular to deploy Kubernetes at the edge for use cases like hybrid environments, IoT and edge computing. However, we have tools\\nlike Kubeedge, SuperEdge, K3s, Microk8s, and Minikube, that have a very low\\nCPU and memory footprint and make it very easy to deploy Kubernetes in low energy devices. But all of that comes with a cost, right? If you remember the threat\\nmodel from Kubernetes, that make it a little\\nbit easier for attackers. So here are 10 things\\nthat you have to think before deploying a Kubernetes\\ncluster next time. So Max. - Yeah, first things first, don't deploy images from untrusted sources in your cluster. Regularly scan your\\nimages for vulnerabilities as have a good source. Second, don't store sensitive\\ndata in Kubernetes secrets. Instead, use an external\\nkey management system or use encryption configuration. Third, encrypt your data in transit. Generate TLS certificates for your workloads using\\ncertificates.k8s.io or use a third party solution\\nlike cert-manager.io. Fourth, enforce security context and limit resource consumption\\nfor your workloads. Prevent those crypto miners please. Fifth, implement network security policies and network segmentation. Choose a CNI plugin that\\nsupports network policies to limit communication\\nbetween your services and monitor network traffic. - Next, access control. Remember to always enable access control. If your cluster is an old cluster, you have pod security policies. If not, use a pod security admission and always follow the\\nprinciple of left privilege. Don't use cluster admin role of course. Next turn on audit logging monitor for initial traffic or wanted API calls. Keep Kubernetes version up\\nto date, patch regularly. Hardening the control play components and lock down the kubelet process. Very important. And finally, adopt a\\nGitOps practice methodology for managing your cluster that will allow you to enhance\\nsecurity, availability, consistency and really it's\\ngonna prevent a single user to make unilateral\\nchanges into your cluster because it has to go\\nthrough a revision process, so that reduce the impact. So with that said, thank you so much for attending this talk. I think we have some time for questions if people want to ask some questions. - Yeah. (audience applauding) - So there is a mic in the, yeah. Front.\\n- Yeah. - [Audience member] Quick\\nquestion for you gentlemen, by the way brilliant call. Do you know of any kind of tools, any of the AST tools that would check for all of those\\nvulnerabilities you spoke to and make recommendations? - AST tools? Like Snyk, like, yeah. So I'm personally familiar with Socket. I know that they do container scanning. I believe Deepfactor also\\ndoes container scanning. Socket is more supply\\nchain vulnerabilities and Deepfactors. I think Deepfactors supply chain as well. That's all what I'm familiar with. - Yeah, there is a bunch of popular tools that I have used in the\\npast for doing like, really like cloud audits. One of that will be Kube-bench. It's gonna check against,\\nyou know, a list of needs, like a checklist of like your cluster. It's certified and has all these\\nsecurity controls in place. There is another very popular\\ncalled NetScout I believe, that will allow you to do really\\nlike cloud security audit, but it has a component to\\ndo specifically Kubernetes and it support pretty much all the clouds. So those are the ones\\nthat I have experience on. Oh yeah. Any other question? No. If not, we are gonna be hanging\\nout at the Dark Arts Village we are there with the\\nPacific Hack Association. If you wanna come, we're gonna be there\\ntalking and have a good one. Thank you so much for attending. - [Max] Thanks for coming everyone.

The session today is FUD versus Reality, Bracing for an AI\\npowered Threat Landscape. So very interesting\\ntopic for us all I\\'m sure our moderator, Jessica Lyons, Cybersecurity Editor at \"The Register.\" Panelist, John Dwyer,\\nDirector of Threat Research and Binary Defense. Srinivas Tummalapenta,\\nDistinguished engineer, CTO, Master Inventor, IBM\\nConsulting Security Services. And Alisha Wikoff, Director\\nof Global Threat Intelligence at America Lead, PricewaterhouseCooper. Thank you. And round of\\napplause for our panel. (audience applauds) - Well, thank you all for joining us and being here again,\\nlast panel of the day. So we\\'re really appreciative\\nto see so many people in the audience. Also, I\\'m sure you all have\\nsat through several panels on AI this week because\\nthat\\'s been a hot topic. But the cool thing about ours is that we\\'re really grounded in reality. This isn\\'t hugely theoretical. I think this one is a lot\\nof useful information, and again, we hope that it all is stuff you can take with you. So as we kick off, I\\'m going\\nto have each of our panelists talk a little bit about their role at their respective organizations\\nand how that informs the lens through which they\\nview the AI powered landscape. So, Srini we\\'ll start with\\nyou to kick us off here. - So, I\\'m part of the\\ncybersecurity services and my role on cybersecurity\\nservices is to use AI for defensive purposes and also\\nhelp clients to build trust with the AI and provide\\nsecure AI solutions. So what I\\'m bringing to\\nthe table here is the value that we are creating for our clients and how we are helping them\\nthrough their AI journey. - Allison. Thanks Jessica, so I lead\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers global threat intelligence practice from an America\\'s point of view. So I have a global team of 35 people across 11 different countries who focus solely on\\nresearching threat actors. So what are they doing?\\nHow are they doing it? Why are they doing it? So I\\'ve got a mix of strategic\\nand technical analysts on my team that produce output for people to be informed about\\nwhat\\'s happening and why. So what I am bringing to this conversation is basically what we\\'re\\nseeing in the threat space and also what we expect\\nto see just based on how threat actors operate. - John? - I was mostly a personality hire, but. - This is true. - It\\'s not bad though, so\\nwhile generally, so our mission as a company at Binary Defense is to make the world a safer place, right? And where my team fits\\ninto that is we have a lot of visibility into\\nwhat\\'s actually going on in the world, and we take that in. And trying to either\\nfind interesting insights or points of view of like what\\'s next or what people need to be prepared for, but also seeing if there\\'s\\ninteresting problems we can try to solve\\nand go into our product and services, you know,\\nto make everything. I would say, like one of the, as an aside, okay, so this is gonna be a recorded, which is great and live on forever. So my message to the future sentient AI overlords that we\\'re all allies and we deserve a great spot in the matrix. That\\'s mostly why I\\'m here. - Thank you, John. You\\'re safe now. So as we talk about AI,\\nit\\'s not a new technology, but Allison, I want to single you out here talk about is this\\nsomething new for criminals to be using and how did\\nyou see cyber criminals using AI kind of prior to the\\nwhole ChatGPT, gen AI boom? - Right, so the way that\\nwe talk about threat actors is motivationally based. So we have seen in the\\npast leading up to gen AI and all these large language models being publicly available that some of the more\\nespionage centric actors were minimally using AI\\ngeneration or image generation, so social engineering type of operations. We think that they were\\nprobably using it for phishing just to make the phishing\\nemails seem more legitimate. But we confirmed, we have a couple groups that we\\'ve seen use AI images in phishing and social engineering operations. - John, did you see much\\nof a change in the way that threat actors were\\nusing gen AI last year? - Well, Allison actually said\\nsomething really excellent to the point which is really, you know, oh you\\'re gonna love this type X so. It can quickly become\\nthe art of the possible in terms of like what\\nadversaries could do with AI. And we get into a lot of\\nspeculation. Did this come from? And quite honestly, unless you\\nhave a deep level of access, it\\'s really hard to confirm. But what Allison said that\\nI completely agree with is that the goals and the\\nobjectives of the adversaries haven\\'t shifted seismically, right? So there is evidence that\\nthey\\'re doing something to accelerate or amplify or improve upon existing attack types, but we haven\\'t seen a monumental shift in the types of attack\\nadversaries are coming with. So we can take that as ground truth to say they\\'re likely if they\\'re using it, they\\'re abusing it to accelerate\\nor amplify an attack type that we already sort of understand. - Right. So, Srini curious what\\nyou have seen in terms of, are you seeing the same\\nlevel of investment that we\\'re seeing from\\nenterprises, defenders, how they\\'re using AI? Are you seeing that\\nsame level of investment from cyber criminals and\\nhow they\\'re using AI? - Yep, so John alluded to one point. So we have seen there are indicators that cyber criminals have\\ninvested into generative AI, AI techniques to make\\nthe attacks more complex, to have high volume attacks\\nand other newer techniques generate newer techniques\\nand evade defenses. So we have seen that definitely and that has come into the attack vectors and we\\'ve seen that as part\\nof our defenses as well, defense strategies as well. We\\'ve also seen attackers or bad actors create their own ChatGPT type environment. So for a fee of less than\\na 100 dollars per month, there is a ChatGPT like\\nenvironment for bad actors. So what that has done is it\\nhas lowered the entry barriers for more people to come into the hacking and be bad actors on that, right? With that, we\\'ll get\\nmore complicated attacks, more volume attacks, more\\nsophisticated attacks, and the spam content creation\\nwill be more sophisticated and more cleaner. So yes, there has been there and then we probably are not seeing\\nthat high volume yet, but there are indicators\\nthat they are there, as Allison was mentioning\\nabout the deepfake. Obviously there are deepfake\\ncreators that are there and that will cause us more\\nproblems in the future. - Right, so I don\\'t know\\nabout the three of you, but I feel like even just\\nlooking at last year\\'s RSA conference versus this year, there was a lot more concern, maybe fear, since the title of our\\npanel is FUD versus Reality. I am curious to see what\\nyou think about if 2023 was the year of FUD, how much\\ndid this concern over AI? And to some extent fear,\\nwas this warranted? Was this concern that we\\nsaw from organizations over the use of AI warranted? John, you wanna tackle that one first? - Yeah, so certainly the\\nwhole title of it is FUD. It was like what\\'s the reality? I actually don\\'t necessarily\\nthink it\\'s a terrible thing that we are talking about a technology before we knead it out\\ninto the public, right? If you think about the lessons\\nthat we\\'ve used in the past, it\\'s like with e-commerce\\nand cloud, you know, we didn\\'t have, there\\nwasn\\'t government hearings about how we were gonna secure this things before it went out. So even though there is a bit of fear, like I would say like the sentient AI coming to take everyone\\'s\\njobs or take over the world is likely fear-based, right? And while you can get\\ngenerative AI to do things, it usually requires a\\nbit of domain expertise for you even to get it out there. So I think there is a bit of that fear mostly in human out of\\nthe loop kind of stuff. There is some concerns\\nwhich is like rightfully so, which is, you know, how\\ncould someone do that? And I think that that\\'s actually a really good conversation point. I think what you\\'ll hear\\nfrom like Allison and Srini is that it\\'s a good conversation to have as long as we\\'re tying it\\nback to what\\'s realistic. - Yeah, I think, you know, from\\nmy view, when I look at AI, there\\'s basically two streams. That I look at it under the\\nlens of the work that I do. One, how can threat actors exploit it? So, you know, we\\'re running our\\nown AI instances internally, can they pollute it, you know, potentially with garbage data? Because again, this is\\nstill a tool, right? Garbage in, garbage out,\\ngood stuff in good stuff out. And then how are threat actors using it for their own operations as well? So that\\'s the lens that we\\'ve\\nsort of been looking at this from like more of a TI perspective. - Yeah, that\\'s certainly\\nthe other part of this is the AI attack surface and then there\\'s the AI threat landscape. We gotta make sure that we\\ndon\\'t conflate those two things, however, they will probably\\nconverge at some point, right? So we are, I would say in a\\npre-mass market time for AI. Like there\\'s no one single\\nintegrator for a platform for AI yet, but when that happens, we\\'re gonna have that\\noverlap of adversarial AI and the threat landscape. And I would say from a fear point of view, like markers that we\\nshould be looking out for. Is when the threat landscape\\nchanges a type of goal and objective that we are\\nnot necessarily prepared for. That is the lesson that we have to take from ransomware, right? Like before enterprise\\nransomware was a thing, we weren\\'t really thinking\\nabout a disruption in the threat landscape that\\nwas used going to extort on the massive scale. And we saw that we\\nneeded to pivot for that. So that\\'s the thing that\\nwe gotta look out for, is when you see a type of\\nattack with a different sort of objective come up, that\\'s when we need to start considering those points. - Let\\'s bring that back\\nto the threat landscape then for a minute too. And not just are the\\npossible but practical. What does that look like\\nright now in practical terms, what are we seeing, how much\\nof an impact does AI have on the threat landscape now? - Well, Srini brought up deepfakes right? And the lower the barrier of entry, that\\'s probably been the\\nthing that\\'s changed the most is ubiquitous access\\nto deepfake technology. Like you can just clone that repo online and it does incredibly great work, right? And you know, Srini can\\ntalk a little bit about some of the research that they\\'ve done, which is very interesting,\\nwhich is in that vein where it doesn\\'t take too much to generate a realistic phishing email\\nwith a AI generated image. Maybe it\\'s an AI generated persona online, and then follow that through\\nwith a real time deepfake. That\\'s realistic, that\\'s\\nthe realistic situation where they\\'re using it\\nas a tool to go through. We\\'re seeing it in the romance\\nscams right now, right? Like we\\'ll find deepfakes. - Yeah, I was reading a\\nreport when we were prepping for this, just Microsoft\\nreleased a report in February on what they were seeing\\nand how the adversaries were using a lot of the AI technology. And it goes back to what\\nwe were talking about in terms of like threat actor motivations. They haven\\'t changed. We\\'re seeing rudimentary\\nuse of these tools to help just kind of speed up the process. So they reported that North\\nKorea based threat actors were doing research on NGOs that were doing North Korea based work. You know, like that\\'s old motivations from that particular space. Iran based threat actors\\nwere doing code development. Again, that\\'s not super surprising. And Russia based threat actors\\nwere doing Satcom research. So again, like I\\'m reading through this and having been in this\\nspace a fair amount of time, I just kind of laughed, you know, they\\'re using this technology the same way we are using it for business purposes. You know, speeding up analysis, getting like menial tasks done\\nthat would normally take us a little bit longer,\\nlike the phishing emails is probably like the best example, right? In the past we were able\\nto tell in some cases when we were being phished because there were grammatical errors or they just completely missed\\nthe boat on things like that, hopefully, well, I won\\'t say hopefully, but that may be a thing of the past now. I mean, we\\'re still seeing some just terrible phishing emails\\nand unfortunately they work, but you know, the tools\\nare still very much in a rudimentary use by a\\nlot of the threat actors, - Right? Oh Srini, do you wanna say something about the threat landscape? I have another FUD based question. - Yeah, let\\'s go for\\nthe FUD based question. - Okay I\\'m curious\\nabout what you\\'re seeing from consumers and especially those who are deploying\\nsecurity technologies. Does this FUD cause\\nthem to lose confidence in the technologies\\nthat they\\'re deploying? - Right, so much like any adoption during even cloud security, cloud adoption and DevOps adoption, right? You\\'ll have consumers or\\ncreators jump in with two feet, some people will tippy toe into it, and some people are\\nvery skeptical onto it. So we have to assume\\nthat as a ground fact. What we should do is\\nwe have to manage them, educate them on creation\\nof AI for example. So I look at it as you\\nare consumer of an AI, you\\'re builder of an AI. So that\\'s our two personal groups. For the consumer of AI,\\nwhat is more important, it\\'s about the accuracy\\nof the information. It\\'s about not having that\\nbias, not hallucinating. That\\'s what they look for. They want that credible\\ninformation come back to them. For the creators of the AI,\\nit\\'s very, very important for them to create trustworthy AI. Where do they start from\\ncreating the trustworthy AI? It\\'s about they trustworthy the data. The data has to be inspected for accuracy, no sensitive information,\\ntrademark information, or any kind of information\\nthat would cause bias or hallucination on that. Once that foundation is created and they have that good data set and they train the model\\non that good data set, and they ensure that models\\ndo not have vulnerabilities and exposures and have\\npossibilities, right? Then you\\'re now creating trustworthy AI with that accurate results. So you are on one creating\\nthe good AI, right? On the other end you are\\neducating the consumers to use the AI in the right way, not to leak sensitive information or do any kind of bad\\nactivity on that particular AI while you are educating and bringing both the personal groups up. That\\'s how you build\\ntrust in terms of adopting that particular AI, right? So this has happened on\\ncloud as well, right? That there are people on\\ncloud who are skeptical about cloud, oh I\\'ll lose my data or you know cloud will\\nhave a lot of exposure. But over a period of time\\npeople started trusting it. And models, consumption models evolve and they now are adopting\\nit in a hybrid way. We will see the same pattern\\non the AI adoption as well. - That\\'s a great (indistinct)\\non the risk and governance we haven\\'t even tapped into that yet. - Yep, but I wanna state one thing, and you may consider\\nthis as I\\'m creating fear and uncertainty here,\\nbut think about this. I just want to have everybody\\nthink about this for a moment. When we create this AI, trustworthy AI. And we are training\\nthe models on the data, for some reason somebody\\nsaid that you are infringing on my trademark or infringing on my data and they\\'ll ask it to be unlearned, okay? Think about it as GDPR policy\\nas right to be forgotten. If the policy comes in and say\\nyou got to unlearn from that, that\\'s a very, very difficult task. So what do we have to do? Right from the get go,\\ncreate trustworthy AI with that trustworthy data, okay? - Yeah, it\\'s a great point. I was just listening and\\nthinking about that of like, the development of these generative AI as we go through is\\ngoing to be shaping a lot of our collective realities\\nof the world, right? So we live in this time and it\\'s only gonna get worse, right? Not worse or let\\'s say it\\'s\\nonly gonna get more complicated. You can live in the same\\nphysical space and experience the world extraordinarily\\ndifferent because your reality is more and more based on\\nwhat you pay attention to. And if we don\\'t have\\ntrustworthy AI where we can say, this is how we came to that answer, we can actually start to\\nshift the public\\'s perception of reality through how this\\nmodel comes to an answer. Because we\\'re gonna get\\nthere, it\\'s a ground truth. I mean I do it all that like, I personally Google stuff a lot less because I just have ChatGPT\\nbasically ask it the question and it does, you know,\\nfor lack of a better term, but the Googling on the back\\nend and gimme the answer. And like, I\\'m often, unless\\nit\\'s something super important, I\\'m not like fact checking that. I\\'m like, yeah, okay. That\\'s\\nthe way we do this now. And to Srini\\'s point is I\\nthink the part that is not FUD that does create concern, at least for me, is how much this technology\\'s\\ngoing to shape our perception of the world around us in the future. - Well and then it gets\\nback to the whole use case for threat actors and cyber\\ncriminals to use it to amplify messages and spread those further. The whole disinformation\\nthat I think is one key use that we\\'re already seeing in terms of AI and how threats can be amplified - Yep.\\n- In that regard too, and so. - If you don\\'t do this correctly, there\\'ll be this old facts\\nembedded into the AI systems and people will retrieve that information and project it as facts. - Right, and again people are doing that even without AI too, but\\nthis can help speed up that process. So I want everyone to pull\\nout their crystal balls now and we\\'re going to look a\\nlittle bit into the future. What do you see in terms of looking ahead at the AI powered threat landscape? How is it changing? What do you\\nexpect to see in the future? And are organizations prepared for this? - Please go.\\n- I\\'ll take a stab at it from a threat actor point of view. So we were talking about this earlier, the threat actor motivations\\nhaven\\'t changed, right? It\\'s just like you said,\\nlowering the barrier of entry for a lot of threat actors\\nto get into this space. So one of the things that\\nI have been thinking about since all of this amazing technology has become so available is I\\nthink about all of the data that has been lost or\\nbreached, credentials. And how it is trivial at this point using these large language models to siphon through that data and find what it is you\\'re\\nparticularly interested in as a threat actor. And I think about all\\nthe historical breaches where we still got this\\ndata floating around, like on the dark web. I had a session earlier,\\nwe were talking about the materiality clause\\nin the new SEC ruling and with AI, are we gonna\\nsee like old breach data crop back up? And people are gonna have\\nto reinvestigate that? Like, is this new, is this old, you know, those types of scenarios\\nare what I\\'m thinking about in terms of threat actor use\\nas this becomes more ingrained in how we do things. - Totally agree. We don\\'t have to do any\\ntechnological advancement to use a large language\\nmodel to do data distillation and summarization. Now data is a currency now\\nthat we can have to use to make our models better,\\nbut like there\\'s been for the last 20 years there\\'s\\nbeen just a exfiltration party going on, right? And so whoever has all of that data, there\\'s now the capability to weaponize it or at least help operationalize things. In the short term. I don\\'t see,\\nspeaking of FUD though like. It gets a lot of clicks\\nbe like, oh I got ChatGPT to write a piece of\\nmalware or whatever, right? You can get a large language\\nmodel and generative AI to write code for you and potentially if you had enough domain expertise, you could actually get it to write some sort of malware that\\nwould technically work, right? But just because something\\'s\\ntechnically possible doesn\\'t mean it\\'s gonna be probable. There\\'s organizations out\\nthere spending $11 billion a year on trying to get generative\\nAI to write code, right? But the last time I checked\\nIBM, Microsoft and Google are still hiring software\\nengineers, right? So if they haven\\'t figured it out, I don\\'t think that the threat actor is gonna be able to write\\nsome terminator malware that can bypass everything\\nand we can work through that and then.\\n- Well, and let\\'s really talk about that. Because threat actors\\nare lazy, like full stop. They are not going to\\niterate unless they have to. And you know, even with\\nsome of the threat actors that we\\'ve seen that have\\nincorporated like AI images into their operations, they\\'re still using like the same phishing themes. We\\'re still seeing phishing works. Not everyone\\'s got MFA everywhere. You know, the TTPs that\\nthreat actors are using have not changed like. - Yeah, scheduled tasks still 20 years run and then the goat of persistence, right? So like what we can take that. - And it works.\\n- Yeah. - Yeah, it works. So Srini let\\'s move back\\nkind of to the defender side of things and I\\'m curious to hear what the defenders need to be doing to protect against these AI threats. - So between the conversation until now, we\\'ve established that the\\nattack surface of AI has changed. And if you look at what has hit the press as there are misconfigurations\\nthat have happened and that potentially leak\\nthe training data set. The second thing is DDoS attacks happened on infrastructure, okay? And outages have been caused, this is large service\\nproviders infrastructure. And third one is deepfakes\\nhave been created and you know, $25 million was transacted\\nby a financial worker because of a deepfake, right? That\\'s the kind of things that you have. Now you see take these three scenarios on how the exposures have happened. If you take the DDoS attack, right, it is conventional attack. We know how to solve the problem. It is an infrastructure based attack, it\\'s a conventional problem. So apply the conventional\\ntechnology that you already have. The second one is misconfiguration happened on the cloud environment, but it\\'s about training dataset. What happens in that training dataset, it can be taken out, data\\ncan be poisoned, put it back and the model will learn out that. It\\'s a conventional\\nthreat, conventional attack took a new meaning on that. But we still have the\\ntechnologies to identify that this is a training data set, this is something that\\nneeds to be applied, now these are the policies\\nthat needs to be applied. So we can use those techniques\\nto apply defensive measures. The third one is it\\'s about\\nthe prompt injections. It\\'s about deepfake creations. These are new attacks,\\nnew threat types, right? So for those things we\\nknew the new detection and response mechanisms\\nin order to protect that. So if you take that kind\\nof an approach, right? And if you take more of\\nan incremental approach and you have what is being\\nconsumed in my enterprise? What is being developed in enterprise, what conventional\\ntechnologies that I have? So I go put the measures,\\ndefensive measures on that right now and what else I need to bring to the\\ntable to protect it. That\\'s how you incrementally evolve along with the AI journey\\nof your business unit. You can also evolve the security and compliance of it and\\nhave them secure by design. - Yeah, I\\'m actually, I\\nmean the people that know me is not shocked that I\\'m\\ngonna have an optimistic view on this, but I actually think\\nfor like AI for security is like that, I think that\\nthis is a moment in time where we actually can start\\nto make things more expensive for the attackers, like if\\nyou really think about it, we\\'ve all said the same thing. We know how these attacks happen. They haven\\'t really\\nchanged their objectives, but they\\'re still successful. And I think that at the end of the day, Srini you\\'ve been working\\non big enterprise data for a long time, is like\\nwe don\\'t necessarily have a capability problem in security. Presented with the right information, humans will generally make the\\nright decision on security. So what we actually have\\nis a context problem. And we finally have a piece of technology that can transform security\\nto contextualize the threat and contextualize activity for an analyst to make a decision. Just we were talking about like with the, how adversaries may do data summarization or data distillation. That\\'s going to change\\nthings for the better if we invest this properly and adding AI for security operations\\nto enhance our people, probably not replace them, - Right, so we\\'ve talked\\nabout deepfakes a little bit. I kind of wanna touch on this more and drill down a little\\nbit about deepfakes, about AI use for deception. As we\\'re all really aware, this is a year where\\nthere\\'s elections happening across the globe. We\\'ve already seen some examples of AI being used for these\\npurposes in other elections here with the Joe Biden robocall even, although I guess that was a magician with a voice that sounded like Joe Biden. So let\\'s touch on how\\ndeepfakes are being used in things like elections, global conflict, just to try to erode\\ngeneral trust in systems like democracy, what are we seeing here? - So the deepfakes both know\\nvoice based, image based and the image and video\\nspace, those are real now. And they can be created\\nwith very minimal effort and investment. I was able to create, I\\'m not a hacker, I\\'ve never done this, but in this case I was wanting to experiment it\\nwith $1 and 10 minutes time. I was able to create a\\nvery decent voice fake. This vendor gave, because\\nthey were charging like $5 a month and they said first month you get a discount of $4. So it only costed me $1, right? So with that voice clone,\\nwe were able to show that this is how the\\nvoice clones can happen and we have a technology to detect and respond on those things. Now think about this as\\nI\\'m not a hacker, right? And this is where the load of\\nbarrier to entry has happened. We have found of, one is a robocalls that happened in the US. And in India, I was observing\\nthe elections of India. There were videos that were\\ndeepfakes of celebrities endorsing a government or a party, which is not in power right now, okay? So they were endorsing those things and they\\'re trying to influence and these people are\\nnot even hackers, right? They\\'re trying to influence the elections to the other party. And there\\'s a huge draw on that. Like, who\\'s going to do the fact checks? Now is that real? Is that not real? And they were expanding\\nthat in terms of, you know, propagating those deepfakes\\nto larger media outlets. So that\\'s one thing in\\nterms of the democracy and how they\\'re trying\\nto influence elections. And during war time there\\nhave been videos released in media in Russia and Ukraine\\nwhere the president\\'s voice, if the video is accurate,\\nbut the president\\'s voice was manipulated and they were\\nsaying they were surrendering. So, which never happened. So that\\'s the kind of impact\\nthat can have on elections and society and democracy at large, which is very risky at this time. We gotta apply the\\ntechnologies that detect, do the fact check and say, okay, at least fingerprint\\nit and say this is good, this is not good, and that\\nway we can establish trust. - And what about just the larger impact on whether or not people trust\\nthese systems like democracy, like the process, not\\nnecessarily just intending to influence or sway an\\nelection one way or other, but what can it do to trust? - When I think about all of\\nwhat we\\'ve been talking about in terms of like deepfakes\\nand there\\'s a whole lot of concern about it,\\nthere\\'s a couple things. One, there\\'s not a whole lot\\nof the technology available in open sources. I wanna know what tool you\\'re using though \\'cause I wanna play with that (laughs). But I think about deepfake\\nand misinformation and I think a lot of it\\nis retraining our users. I think we\\'ve done a really good job with like the social engineering stuff, but I think about a lot\\nof these business email compromise type attacks\\nwhere they are leveraging like a little bit of trust\\nwithin the organization or account takeovers and things like that. I think we\\'ve taught most of our folks not to just trust blindly. I think we need to enhance\\nthat conversation to include all of this new technology\\nwhere there is the capability to trick people into what they\\'re seeing being actually true or not. - I\\'ll respond to your\\nquestion (indistinct) I\\'ll not state the one that I used to. - No afterwards when\\nwe\\'re not being recorded. - So I\\'ll definitely share. But the detect and response\\ntechnology was the one which won the RSA sandbox competition. They\\'re announced as a\\ntop innovator of this. - That\\'s awesome. And probably either John or Allison, if you wanna jump in\\nhere too, I\\'m curious, I know Allison, you talked about how a lot of these groups are using\\nAI to advance their motives that aren\\'t new. But I\\'m curious, what are you\\nseeing and who\\'s investing, what are you seeing from nation states? What are you seeing from criminal gangs? How are they using these tools? - It\\'s hard to tell because\\nwe don\\'t have a lot of insight into like the outcome. But again, I think they\\'re using them the same way that we are, right? How do we speed up operations? How do we mass analyze large data sets, whether it be vulnerability\\ninformation or breach data or you know, automation of things that used to be manual\\nefforts on their behalf. So again, it\\'s really hard to tell what they\\'re doing specifically unless it\\'s right in our face. Like, you know, a terrible\\nfake human that\\'s masquerading as someone they\\'re not or deepfake. Fortunately a lot of those so far, the ones that I\\'ve seen\\nare pretty suspect. You know, make you question\\nwhat you\\'re looking at. But it remains to be seen\\nwhat that will look like without some of the\\ncompanies that are running these AI tools being very transparent about what they\\'re seeing. So that Microsoft report\\nI thought was excellent just in terms of\\nconfirming what we thought they were doing using these technologies. - Yeah, I\\'ll say out of\\nthe misinformation piece mostly \\'cause it\\'s terrifying - Yeah (laughs). - About using that. But from the threat landscape,\\nif you take nothing else away from me or us up here about how do you manage threats in 2024, I hopefully this is coming\\nthrough is that the goals and the objectives of the adversary is our guiding light\\nto drive our strategy. We have to pay. Like it is very easy for us \\'cause we\\'re all nerds and\\nwe love the technical bits and it\\'s very easy to dive into the MITRE ATT&CK techniques and these are the new malware\\nbypasses and stuff like that. It\\'s very easy to get in\\nthere and those change, right? The technical implementation\\nof how this stuff goes on does change, the goals and the objectives have not changed, right? So when we talk about how\\nwere they possibly using it, who knows really, unless\\nyou actually have access, you\\'re speculating right at that point. And I think that\\'s kind of dangerous. But what we can do is see\\nthe cause and the effect of an attack. And say what was their goal at the end, what was their objectives and\\nhow they went through that? And did we see a seismic change? No. Then are likely we are\\nenhancing our continued strategy. Now when we get to the point, whenever we have potentially like an AI, like a criminally designed\\nlarge generative AI model that is super charming,\\nwe\\'ll call it DwyerGPT. (panelists laugh) And that this is what I\\'m talking about. Like this is what you need to think about from a goals and objective point of view. I\\'m getting outta the ransomware game and instead I\\'m going to\\ndeploy my super charming generative AI model out on the internet and I\\'m gonna have my\\nmodel convince your model to make business or investment decisions that benefit myself. Like that\\'s a change in objective, right? And that\\'s the kind of stuff\\nthat we need to look out for so we don\\'t get lost in the sauce, right? It\\'s very cool and we all\\nkind of love this thing, but take nothing else away from that is that we really need\\nto take a step back, we\\'re talking about the threat landscape and boil it down into what\\nis the action on objective at the end, right? - And threat actor motivations, I mean it really hasn\\'t changed. You know, we as an industry\\nwrite annual reports year over year and when we\\nget down to the nuts and bolts of why threat actors are\\ndoing what they\\'re doing, it\\'s money, it\\'s espionage,\\nit\\'s other strategic objectives that they\\'re trying to accomplish. I don\\'t really see that\\nchanging anytime soon. I mean, there are things that influence what they\\'re focusing on in that spectrum of objectives just depending\\non what\\'s happening. But fundamentally that\\'s\\nprobably not gonna change all that much. - Right, and there was just\\nthat report about those people that stole someone\\'s ChatGPT\\nkeys or something like that and it was like crypto jacking for LLMs. They\\'re basically using their API key to then make free of charge LLM resources. But that goes back into making\\nmoney or resource hijacking. - Or collection objectives.\\n- Or collection objectives. Like this is all tied\\ntogether, man, you know, - But one addition point\\nI\\'ll put to that is, there\\'ll be a lot more nuisance value that will be created, right? In addition to the, you know,\\nstate actors motivations, there\\'ll be like normal people\\nwho have access to this toys will play around with\\nand just create nuisance. - Yeah, the scale is certainly\\nlike, which is why we need to adopt this in security\\nbecause it\\'s going to scale and we need to scale\\nappropriately to keep pace, right? And I think we\\'ll get ahead of that. - Yeah, well along those lines, I mean, Srini you were\\ntalking about the voice clone you created with a dollar\\nto make a very convincing voice clone. I mean, it seems to me\\nthat that\\'s a cheap way, low barrier entry and that has a potential to dismantle these really\\nimportant identity controls that enterprises have implemented. So are they prepared for that? - So clients have come to us and said, we have a speaker\\nbased authentication system. We think that it is exposed\\nnow, what do we do about it? So we are now working with them and say, okay, you have\\na speaker based system, now let\\'s put a detection methodology and say send the voice first,\\ndetect it that it is true, then send it to the authentication\\nmaking system, right? Similarly in terms of the\\ncall center operations, when people make calls\\nand asking for information about clients or other things. So you also have to detect\\nthat that call is genuine and then send it to the next\\nlevel or alert the operator to ask more questions about it. So large financial\\norganizations have come up, they came to us asking\\nfor potential solutions. There\\'s also, as part of\\nyour know your client, they\\'ll take digital images. That could be photographs,\\nit could be driver licenses. There\\'s a use case from\\nJapan that came to us and say, we\\'re seeing a lot of\\nfraud accounts being created \\'cause they\\'ve just been\\ndigitally morphed images and driver licenses information, right? So for those things, we gotta have this detection technologies. Send it through that\\nvalidate, that\\'s good, then send it to the next step and let the business process flow. So now we have to just up our defense like what John was mentioning, right? We see this, we have to up our defenses, put the necessary technologies and let the business continue. - Well, I think we wanna leave\\na little time for Q&A here. So in light of that, I\\nwould like each of you to offer a takeaway. What do you want our audience to take away from our discussion, bring\\nhome to their organizations? Srini, let\\'s start with you. - So I\\'ll summarize what I stated firstly. It is about there are\\ndefenses available today. Can apply that, help your AI creators to build trustworthy AI. We as security practitioners\\nhave to have seat at the table, that governance table and\\nhelp them to inspect the data, secure the data and transit it and best, help them to build that trustworthy AI. That\\'s number one. I\\'m a big believer in\\nzero trust principles, never trust, always verify. - Yeah, so from my perspective,\\nI think that we need to remember that again, threat actors are new to this technology\\njust like we are and the way that we\\nare looking to optimize our business practices data analysis, the threat actors are\\ndoing the same thing. And again, I said this\\nbefore, they\\'re lazy. If things work as they are, they\\'re not going to adopt\\nsomething more difficult to achieve their objectives. Which again, those aren\\'t\\ngonna change either. - I am actually gonna\\ngive you some homework that I\\'m really interested in. And I think what I want you guys, your call to action from\\nmyself, is that you likely already have some sort\\nof AI attack surface through the deployment\\nmachine learning has been out for a long time. And you probably have\\nmachine learning models hanging out on your end points. And I would like you guys\\nto go ahead and start, just assess how often people\\nare going to Hugging Face and downloading a model. How many people are going\\nand grabbing a model off of an S3 bucket? How many times someone\\'s\\ninstalling TensorFlow through Python? Do that homework to try\\nto audit what it is. And I\\'m a walking\\ntalking golden retriever, so you can hit me up on LinkedIn and we\\'ll talk a little bit about what that actually exists\\nand then I want you to, the next piece of that is\\nhow can that attack surface fit into the goals and the objectives of the adversary today? I think that\\'ll do a great\\njob in getting you started on how we think about\\nsecuring your organization in 2030 and 2035 and beyond. - Well thank you all. We have a couple mics if anybody\\nwants to ask any questions to our panelists here. - Thank you very much\\nfor the conversation. I have a question about the two examples that were brought in here, right? One was deepfake and the\\nother one was phishing. And the deepfake example, actually yesterday Sans was\\ndoing a keynote presentation and they had that as one of the, you know, top new threats that everyone\\nhas to watch out for. The question I have for the panel, but maybe specifically for Srini, why is it so hard for a\\nmachine learning model to detect deepfake versus not a deepfake? A human being cannot, right? But when you\\'re actually creating a model with like maybe a million\\nparameters over there for every pixel, why\\ncan it not detect that? And same goes for phishing emails as well. There is always going to be that one thing that the fraudster cannot do\\nthat a legitimate thing can do. - Yeah, so there\\'s actually\\na solution right now to detect deepfake voices,\\ntext videos, and images, okay? And much like you mentioned\\nit\\'s based on machine learning and so it has algorithms,\\nthree different algorithms and an ensemble algorithm,\\nit\\'s able to crawl through the entire packet,\\nwhether it\\'s audio or video or images and then identify where exactly the fake was inserted,\\nwhether it\\'s audio morphed or video morphed. So I\\'m just giving out\\nthe name of the company, it won the Sandbox competition\\na couple days back. Reality Defender is\\nthe name of the company and they\\'re exactly doing, they have a solution,\\nthey\\'re doing that part. And that\\'s what we are looking at, bringing that technology\\ninto those examples that I mentioned about speaker\\nbased authentication systems, call center operations. We are bringing that technology\\nto do that inspection and response. - Alright, great question though. And just your instincts are great because machine learning can actually detect machine learning. Where we\\'re kind of tripping it up, and this is what Srini\\nis kind of alluding to, is that we haven\\'t architected\\nthose sort of solutions into our infrastructure. Yeah so we have to prepare for that, giving that as an\\nadditional telemetry source going in the future. - The other question was about GDPR. So you mentioned it\\'s\\nvery hard to delete data if the customer says delete my data, it\\'s also applicable to\\nCCPA, I think, right? - Yes. - Is it hard to make the model\\nunlearn or is it impossible to make the model unlearn. - So it\\'s about cost, right? So for example, so one of our researchers, security researchers at\\nIBM is doing this job. So she came up and said, she\\ngave me a muffin example. Say here\\'s a muffin, there\\nare cranberries and nuts that I\\'m trying to... The unlearning process that\\nshe was citing as an example is I want to delete those,\\ntake out those cranberries and nuts. That\\'s the unlearning\\npart of it. I said fair. And she\\'s figuring it out\\nand with low cost, right? This is not about take that\\ndata out of the data set and then retrain it. It\\'ll take six months and you know, a lot of computer\\nresources will be required. So she\\'s figuring out a way to\\njust take out the cranberries and nuts, that\\'s one part of unlearning. But the question I had for her is, okay, the muffin has sugar and butter in that. And the sugar is the bad sugar. I want to take the sugar\\nout. How do we do it? That\\'s a difficult task. It\\'s a research activity that is underway. We are figuring out the\\nnuts and cranberries. We will figure out the\\nsugar. It\\'s not there yet. It\\'ll take some time and expense. - Okay, thank you very much. - Your welcome. - Any other questions? Well great, well thank\\nyou all for joining us and hope you enjoyed our talk.

I am a cyber operations planner with the Joint Cyber Defense\\nCollaborative or JCDC at the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency. And I\\'m joined here today\\nby my JCDC colleague and fellow Cyber Operational\\nplanner, Trevor Parks, as well as Lance Pierce,\\nwho is the CEO of NetHope, and Leah McGrath, who is the executive\\ndirector of StateRAMP. And I guess to just kick it off, who here is familiar with JCDC? Just raise your hand. Okay, that\\'s a fair number of people. So for those of you who\\naren\\'t familiar with JCDC, our mission is to unite\\nthe global cyber community and the collective defense of cyberspace. And we do that through\\npublic private partnership. So as cyber operations planners, Trevor and I are really focused on how we can work with partners\\nacross the cyber ecosystem to really buy down cyber risk through what we call\\nstrategic planning efforts. So in March of last year, we initiated a planning effort to bolster the digital resilience of high risk communities. And when we\\'re talking\\nabout high risk communities, we\\'re talking about nonprofits, NGOs, humanitarian organizations, and the activists, human rights defenders, academics, you name it, that work for them that might be targeted by\\nadvanced persistent threat actors. And we saw a need for this planning effort because we\\'re increasingly seeing a rise in digital transnational\\nrepression across the globe. And so as adversaries are\\nincreasingly using technology to intimidate, surveil, harass, and even silence dissidents, we\\'re increasingly seeing\\nthese high risk communities caught in the crosshairs. So as we kind of initiated\\nthis planning effort, as we do with all planning efforts, JCDC joined forces with\\nour interagency partners like the Department of State and industry partners like\\nCisco, IBM and Authenticate. But what was really unique\\nabout this planning effort was that we also partnered with civil society organizations like Net Hope and like StateRAMP that really specialize in digital security for high risk communities and what we also call target rich, cyber poor\\norganizations as well. And so that\\'s why I\\'m really excited to be joined by Lance and Leah today, because both NetHope and\\nStateRAMP really helped to, in a very major way, shape the way that JCDC understands the cybersecurity challenges that high risk communities face and where our planning effort\\ncould really add value. So in the next 50 minutes, we will dive into some of\\nthe cybersecurity challenges that high risk communities face, and then talk about some of the ways that our industry in the room as well as other government\\nand civil society organizations can really help bolster\\nthe digital security of these organizations. So Lance, I\\'d like to start with you. Can you tell us a little bit about NetHope and in particular, can you talk about who are your member organizations and what are some of the\\ncybersecurity challenges that they face? - Sure. Happy to do that, Leah, thank you very much for\\nhaving us on the panel today. And thank you also very\\nmuch for the invitation to take part in the planning effort, it\\'s been incredibly important and we appreciate the opportunity to represent the voice of Civil Society in helping shape some of these things, especially for the\\ninternational organizations. So yeah, I\\'m Lance Pierce,\\nthe CEO of NetHope. And NetHope is a 23-year-old partnership between Silicon Valley and the world\\'s leading relief development and conservation organizations. So our corporate partners are many of the tech\\ncompanies you\\'ve heard of, the Microsofts, the\\nCiscos, the Salesforce, the AWS, Googles and so on. Whereas our members are also many of the international\\norganizations you\\'ve heard of, Oxfam, Care, Save the Children, Catholic Relief Services,\\nWorld Vision, and so on. About half our members are\\nlocated in the United States, and about half are located in the UK, Europe, and Switzerland. So we have been working really\\nin and around cybersecurity since the very beginning. We\\'ve been an organization\\nthat\\'s brought together CISOs and brought together technology experts, digital experts in program to really use the power\\nof technology and data to help accelerate the mission of our member organizations. And so we\\'ve been really looking at this threat landscape over the last couple of years, and as a result of formalized the Digital\\nProtection Program at NetHope, which for us brings together\\nreally three things, it brings together cybersecurity, which is again, the\\nsort of the main driver that brings us here to RSA this year. But it also brings together safeguarding of people who participate\\nin programs and staff, because people who work for\\ninternational organizations in humanitarian context are often subject to\\nunique risks and dangers. And it also brings together\\nphysical protection because the cybersecurity\\nthreat model does not include someone kicking in your door, putting a gun to your head\\nand demanding your passwords. Whereas many of the\\norganizations we work with, they work in war zones or conflict zones, do actually infact face that threat. So we try to bring all of that together under the umbrella of digital protection. And like many of you, like so many of the themes here at this event this past week, we\\'ve been hearing about just the marked increase in cyber attacks that are occurring everywhere, and international civil\\nsociety is not immune to that. We have been seeing dramatic rise in the number of attacks, the number of kind and\\nsophistication of attacks on organizations like this. And when our members get attacked, often the case in a corporate setting or a government setting, you can isolate the threat,\\nyou can shut it down, you can apply various tools and methods to help solve the problem or at least contain it\\nuntil you can deal with it. But the challenge in the humanitarian context in particular is that if you apply those typical tools and approaches that are common in the private sector and\\nprobably governed as well, lives may be lost because open access to those systems has always been a foundation of the ability to operate in these challenging\\nand marginal contexts. And so shutting systems down in the name of digital hygiene often means that people\\ndon\\'t get access to services, sometimes they die. And so it\\'s a particularly\\nchallenging environment. So we\\'ve done some research\\nthat in the past year that really shows that about two thirds of international organizations don\\'t feel confident in\\ntheir cybersecurity efforts. About two thirds also\\nfeel like they underspend on cybersecurity, but yet three quarters of them say that the threat is going up not down. So it\\'s a challenging environment from the threat landscape point of view, but also from the resource\\npoint of view as well. So many of you, if you know anything about\\nthe nonprofit sector, you know that organizations often work on what\\'s called restricted funding. It\\'s where grant makers will allocate a certain portion of money to go out to the mission\\nof the organization and they tell you what\\nyou can spend on overhead. And technology is frequently lumped into the overhead category. So it\\'s often the case, you have to make very hard trade offs between serving your\\nconstituents with grant money that you may have to top up shortfalls in your grant making, or shore up your cybersecurity or any of the other needs that you have, \\'cause we\\'re operating in a resource constrained environment. So cybersecurity has, in recent years, just been at the low end\\nof the trade-off curve. It\\'s just been traded off,\\ntraded off, traded off. But now that\\'s changing because again, the nature\\nof the threat\\'s increasing, it\\'s being automated\\nand made cheaper by AI. And it\\'s not just ransomware, it\\'s also frequently organizations are targeted for their data. Because if you\\'re working\\nin an international context, sometimes the nonprofits actually know things the\\ngovernments don\\'t know. And therefore, sometimes\\ngovernment actors, which are one of the biggest attackers of civil society in these\\ncontexts around the world, are seeking to get that data for some form of advantage, or to cause active harm. So it\\'s a different sort of landscape and we really have tried to spin up a couple of programs to help these organizations. We have a digital protection\\nprogram, which I mentioned, which does a lot of training, capacity building, career development. And we\\'ve also with USAID and Okta, a couple of years ago we launched the Global Humanitarian ISAC, which is an entity that is intended to help try to provide more of a collective security approach to the civil society sector\\nworking around the world. So it\\'s got some unique challenges, but I\\'m really delighted to\\nsay as people come together, we\\'ve heard some of the\\nthemes at this conference. It seems like awareness is growing and I think that\\'s really exciting, and particularly the opportunity\\nto work with the government and to help try to develop some of these shared approaches to an ongoing problem. - Yeah, absolutely. And thank you so much for that overview. So I wanna dive into some of\\nthe challenges you mentioned, but first I wanna turn to Leah, and could you give a\\nlittle bit of a flavor for some of the types of organizations that StateRAMP works with, and do you see that they face a lot of the same challenges\\nthat Lance mentioned, or is it a different set of\\ncybersecurity challenges? - If you talk to states\\nand local governments, who is our primary member, all of our local governments, and I come from local governments, we consider ourselves snowflakes, each of us are a little bit different. But the reality is, and I think we\\'ve found\\nthis on the task force, we have a lot of the same challenges. - We do.\\n- And so there were so many different correlations, and even as you were talking now, Lance, that we\\'ve experienced. So StateRAMP is a nonprofit, we\\'re a membership organization and we serve both the public\\nsector and private sector. On the public sector, our\\nmembers include states, local governments, K12, higher ed, and then our private sector members are technology companies\\nwho are servicing, providing services to state and local government and education. And then also just the rest of the cybersecurity ecosystem\\nfrom consultants to advisors to the ones who are doing the audits. The challenges that we see, and I\\'ll just put it into context, I\\'m from Indiana, woohoo, mid Midwest. I\\'m the state you\\'re probably flying over to get home after this. But we have great people, and we have our state government, but we also have over 500 municipalities that\\'s include cities and towns who have hundreds of people to hundreds of thousands of people. We have 92 counties, almost\\n300 school districts. Every one of those organizations is facing the same challenges that you described-\\n- Yep, that\\'s right. - In terms of, they have a lot of pressure from the citizens who elect them to make sure that they\\nare putting the dollars to the services, the dollars to the classrooms, or the dollars to the services\\nthat they\\'re providing. And cybersecurity and technology for a long, long time just got pushed into that\\nadministrative bucket of expenditures that we try\\nto keep really, really low. we try to keep the overhead really low/ And that means that there\\'s a lot of deferred investment and maintenance and attention that has happened. And the other thing, so you\\'ve got resource constraints, but we also, I\\'ve not talked\\nto an organization yet who has all the budget\\nand bandwidth and talent that they would like to have on staff to be able to do the\\nthings they need to do from cybersecurity standpoint. And these are target rich\\nfrom a cyber crime standpoint. And these are the organizations who are teaching our kids, who are managing our police data and our criminal information data. and really importantly, managing a lot of our critical\\ninfrastructure utilities like water and wastewater in\\nthe rural areas, broadband. And so the StateRAMP exists, we were founded by current\\nand former state leaders who came together with industry to say, Hey, one of the challenges that we face is how to manage third party risks. How do we manage third party suppliers? And how do we know that when we\\'re partnering\\nwith a technology that it meets minimum security standards, not just now but ongoing. How do we have visibility into that? Because we know we have\\nresponsibility for our environment and for training our people\\nand for doing those updates, but what about the technologies\\nthat we\\'re reliant on to serve our constituents? And so that\\'s why StateRAMP\\nwas formed to help with that. But our mission is to educate on best practices for cybersecurity. So we find ourselves really\\nkind of in two buckets. One, trying to help those providers who need to mature their cyber posture to grow that and mature that. But then two, to really\\npartner with organizations like MS-ISAC and Center\\nfor Internet Security and others to be able to\\nprovide that education to our participating governments, whether that\\'s K12 schools or local governments to try to say, Hey, there\\'s a shared responsibility here and how can we help make\\nthat simpler for you? So we\\'ve seen a lot of\\nthe same challenges. And on the task force, I\\nthink that\\'s what we realized, was when we\\'re talking\\nabout these under-resourced, target rich, smaller organizations\\nor big organizations, we\\'re all facing a lot\\nof the same challenges and it\\'s going to require the private industry coming alongside and all of us finding those\\npoints of collaboration to be able to address them. - Amazing. And so I think what your responses have highlighted are Net Hope is focused more on kind of the larger international NGOs, StateRAMP is focused more\\non smaller organizations that have an outsized impact\\non their local communities \\'cause of the critical public services that they\\'re providing. So Trevor, turning to you,\\nCISA has a growing focus on what we call target rich, resource poor or target rich, cyber poor organizations. So can you talk a little bit about how CISA thinks about\\nhigh risk communities kind of in relation to\\ntarget rich, resource poor, and then in addition to that, why does CISA care about these entities, even when they don\\'t fall neatly under a particular critical\\ninfrastructure sector? - Yeah, so that\\'s a really\\ngood question, Emily. The reason why CISA is really kind of vested in the protection of these high risk communities is they actually do do a lot of work within our critical infrastructure. You have organizations that\\nwork within healthcare, that work within education, as Lance pointed out earlier, some of these organizations\\nhave a lot of data that maybe the government isn\\'t even aware of that they have. So we really want to make sure that we are helping\\nthem protect their data because in doing that we are protecting our\\nown interests as the US, and helping protect our\\ncritical infrastructure. We also see, as Leah was point out, that a lot of these smaller\\norganizations in rural areas, or K through 12 schools, they have a lot of the same pain points that these high risk\\ncommunities have as well. So there are a lot of the lessons that we can pull from having\\ncreated a Project Upskill and this project entirely, that we can look and say, we can actually apply this in other areas because we know that these solutions can help in some way to\\nhelp those organizations. - Awesome. And so Lance,\\nto go back to a point that you made a little bit earlier, so director Easterly and\\ntestimony on the Hill has said recently that, \"Cyber risk is business risk.\" But I think for a lot of the organizations that we\\'re talking about today, cyber risk is actually mission risk. - Yes. - And so I think whether it\\'s an international\\nhumanitarian organization or your local health clinic, the stakes are really high when it comes to cybersecurity. So could you talk a little bit about within the context of NetHope, like what are the stakes for your members when it comes to cybersecurity? - Yeah, and I just want to emphasize Leah\\'s point as well that\\nthese are the same attackers. This would probably not have been the case five, 10 years ago, that the same attackers would be coming after local governments\\nin the United States or international organizations\\nworking in conflict zones. But today that\\'s not true. They\\'re the same people, it\\'s the same entities,\\nthe same institutions. And ransomware of course is a problem because that\\'s the money, that\\'s the operating\\nlifeblood of the organization and that is an issue and that\\'s often what we focus on. But in our sector, as I mentioned, the data is increasingly important, data as a commodity being stolen and in war zones that can\\nbe particularly sensitive because we\\'ve seen, Ukraine\\nis a good example of this, where data\\'s been stolen\\nfrom local nonprofits in an attempt to sort out who to monitor, who to harass. and who to target for kill. And so the challenge of course is, is that all of our programs, all of our organizations\\ntoday are digital. Digital is not locked\\nup in a closet somewhere that\\'s sort of metered out\\nby the high priests of IT, so people get to use it\\nthe way that it used to be, it\\'s now distributed, it\\'s everywhere in your organization, it sits in every job description, every seat in your organization is a generator and a consumer of data. And your programs are all driven by data. It\\'s all driven by your\\nability to track your metrics, track your participation,\\ntrack your impact. So with the collection of all of that being necessary to do your work, you also have a higher responsibility to protect that data. And if you collect the data to do the work and the data gets stolen\\nand harm comes to people, you may be in a situation\\nas an organization where you\\'ve actually done the opposite of what your mission is. The data, if it can\\'t\\nbe adequately protected, may then be used to harm the people that you\\'re trying to help. And so this is why we see leadership in some of the international organizations beginning to wake up to the fact that this\\nquestion of cybersecurity is really existential for them. That if you have to collect\\ndata to do your work and you can\\'t adequately protect the data, you shouldn\\'t collect the data, that means you can\\'t do your work. But has been said multiple times throughout RSA this week, by large influential companies to large well-resourced\\ninfluential companies, we can\\'t do this alone. And that\\'s especially true for I think state and local government, and certainly for civil society, we really do need to find collective ways of working together in order\\nto get out ahead of this and get around this. The various ISACs have\\nbeen mentioned here. We partner with Center\\nfor Internet Security, which has been a tremendous partner, tremendous resource partner to us. We benchmark our members\\nagainst the CIS controls, they\\'ve really helped us with the design of the global humanitarian ISAC. They of course run two of the ISACs, the state and local ISAC and then the elections ISAC. And so that\\'s a good example, that and the other industry ISACs are good examples of how\\npeople have banded together to kind of address some of these issues. We think more collective action is gonna be required, not less, more thoughtful information sharing, more strategic ways of working together. A lot of this is not a product problem, it\\'s not a technology problem. I mean, to be sure if you\\'re dealing with military grade software that\\'s being deployed in attack mode or AI that\\'s automating that, that\\'s the technology problem. But so much of this comes\\ndown to human error, social engineering attacks, deception, and playing on the trust\\nand goodwill of people to gain access to trusted spaces. And so that really does take a village to help try to manage that\\nin a way that we can continue to retain the trust and do the work that needs to be done here in some of the lifesaving work, particularly that our member\\norganizations work on. - That\\'s super helpful. And Leah, I\\'d like to ask\\nyou a similar question. So Lance had mentioned earlier that funding is always a challenge, right? And so within StateRAMP\\'s kind of work and especially your work with K through 12\\norganizations, municipalities, how do you kind of navigate those tensions between the funding and also communicating the stakes and like why organizations need to be investing in cybersecurity? - We have some, it\\'s a great question. We have some really\\ngreat strategic partners and so try to collaborate there to kind of bring that full circle, whether it\\'s working with NASCIO, the National Association of State Chief Information Officers, MSI-2 and CIS as you mentioned, and so many more who I think can help really\\nprovide those resources. What we really do and\\nfocus on at StateRAMP is create a shared service, where you have a shared common problem, there\\'s usually an opportunity for a shared common solution. And so we have a verification process or security programs that\\nallows then providers who serve government\\nto kind of verify once, modeled in part after\\nFedRAMP the federal program, and then we also have a\\nprogressing program as well that allows folks to kind\\nof gives them a runway and step into it and\\nmature their programs. So that program\\'s really important because it allows providers to be able to kind of do it once, in order to serve their\\nmany government customers in K12 and states and locals. And then it allows the governments to be able to kind of offload that burden of having to do that verification. They\\'re still responsible for what only they can be responsible for, that risk management. But it allows that kind\\nof shared service model. So by doing that, we are helping relieve some of that burden and giving them the opportunity to focus resources elsewhere. Then we, as I mentioned,\\npartner with strategic partners, partner with our members to be able to deliver education\\nand say, what\\'s the gap? Where do we need to go now? And really the gap that we\\'ve seen on the state and local\\nside is helping mature that risk management program. So we\\'ve been developing\\na framework for adoption of StateRAMP that helps\\nthem, states, locals, any government entity kind of\\ncoming through the process, step in where they\\'re ready. And then it\\'s a milestone based approach to maturing that risk management program. And I think that\\'s what\\nwe have to really embrace, is that concept of, how do we just take small\\nincremental steps to get better? How do we find areas\\nwhere we can work together to kind of share the burden? And that can be hard to do because especially in government, I don\\'t know about your\\nworld, but in government, I call it the merry-go-round of what ifs and but this-\\n- Yes. - And so you have to be able to go, okay, I\\'m gonna put aside\\nthe 10% where we\\'re different and where that Snowflake label does apply and focus on that 90% where\\nwe have the same goals or challenges and focus there. And so we really, we\\'ve got all the committee structures that try to help drive toward that kind of commonality and consensus, but that\\'s where we really try to focus. - Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. And I think kind of continuing on that education and awareness theme.\\n- Yeah. - So within the JCDC planning effort that we were working\\non over the past year, one of the areas where we really saw that we could add value because we\\'d heard from\\nseveral stakeholders is that a lot of, at\\nlike at the staff level, a lot of these organizations, there\\'s kind of the lack of awareness of how personal cyber hygiene can translate to\\norganizational cybersecurity and then how that\\ntranslates to mission risk. And so one of the things\\nthat we did through RJCDC planning effort was create what we call Project Upskill, which is a series of\\ncybersecurity hygiene guides that are really aimed for more\\nof a non-technical audience to help them take steps to really be able to improve\\ntheir personal cyber hygiene. So Trevor, having worked with you on developing Project Upskill, I think we both learned\\njust how challenging it is to develop cybersecurity guidance for individuals whose day jobs don\\'t really revolve around\\ninformation technology. So could you talk to me a little bit about like what was the intent\\nbehind Project Upskill, and what were some of the considerations that went into it? - Yeah, so we did learn a\\nlot of really good lessons through developing Project Upskill. We wanted to hear the voices\\nof these organizations. A lot of what CISA has done traditionally has been enterprise level cybersecurity. And one of the challenges we were facing is these organizations just\\ndon\\'t have the manpower or infrastructure to even utilize that level of protection in their systems. So we had to sit, look\\nand say, okay, well, what do they have? And it\\'s a lot of what\\neveryone else has at home. In their pocket right now\\nthey have their own phone, they have their own laptop, they probably have their own wifi at home, or they have a small office, where they\\'re taking care of their entire digital ecosystem, and what cybersecurity tools\\nare part of those ecosystems and how do we get it to a point to where someone who doesn\\'t have a cybersecurity background understands all the\\nthings that they can do throughout their own digital ecosystem to make it a harder target for these advanced\\npersistent threat actors who are no longer satisfied with going after big\\ncompanies and governments. They\\'re going after these\\nsmaller organizations who don\\'t have those\\nenterprise level protections. So there\\'s a lot of things\\nout there that they could do, but it\\'s very hard to\\nfind that information on where that is. You know, if you find a\\nsetting in one of your devices, you can look it up on Google, and you might find 10 pages telling you three different things that you should or shouldn\\'t do with it. But we really wanted all\\nthat advice in one location so someone could go through it and basically do a checklist of, okay, what do I need to do? What can I do today to help\\nmyself be a little bit safer? And that was a very hard set because we had also look at it from what is someone capable of understanding and doing themselves So there might be a lot of settings that you have in your device that if you\\'re a\\ncybersecurity professional, you know what it is, you\\nknow how to flip it on, and you\\'re comfortable with\\nthat degradation of access because you have the more security. But someone that doesn\\'t\\nwork in this industry might not understand why\\nthey need to turn that on. So we really wanted to kind of educate \\'em on the reason why you\\'re\\ndoing these things is for these level of\\nbenefits to protect your data. Like this is part of an entire ecosystem that you have to watch out for. And I think that was really\\none of the best things that came out of there, along with working with some of our private industry partners and actually getting some of those tools, those free services that you can actually find on our high risk community webpage that they have offered up\\nfor these organizations to be able to utilize if they so choose. - Awesome. And I think to pull the\\nthread a little bit more here, so we saw Project Upskill as filling kind of a critical\\ngap in CISA\\'s guidance for high risk communities, but I also want to fully acknowledge that Project Upskill still puts\\nthe burden of security on individuals or organizations that are probably least equipped to do so. And so if we really do\\nwanna make a difference in this space, we really do\\nneed industry to take action. So as we are preparing for this panel, we had the idea to\\ncollaborate on a blog post where we listed some of the top things that industry can do to support target rich,\\nresource poor organizations and also high risk communities. So one of the recommendations that came out of that blog post was for companies to embrace\\nSecure by Design principles. So Lance, I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate on why it\\'s\\nso important for companies to be embracing these\\nSecure by Design principles, and in particular, like\\nwhat impact does this have for high risk communities? - The technology teams at some of the really large\\ninternational organizations can be quite good and quite sophisticated, but the problem is there\\naren\\'t as many of those at the global level or when you get into\\ntheir country offices, then you have a different\\nlevel of skills and expertise. So things that are, Secure by Design actually that are designed to be used in a largely safe fashion, I think is very important just given the skills gap\\nthat\\'s still out there, the knowledge gap, the awareness gap. We have found that in\\nmany of the organizations we work with just on the sort of the threat information\\nlevel, for example, we could provide people with the best threat information that\\'s out there because of our industry partners, but they wouldn\\'t be\\nable to make use of it. That there\\'s not the capacity\\nwithin the organization or the decision making authority to be able to make\\ndecisions about resources, about strategy, about\\ndeployment and so and so. If the technology is either going to exacerbate that and make that worse, or it\\'s gonna provide\\nsome bit of backstopping while organizations skill up in this way as they\\'re increasingly waking up to the fact they have to do. And again, this was not\\na skillset that was, it was sort of, I think\\none of us was talking about how it was assumed that the person who hooked up the printer was gonna cover you\\nwith your cybersecurity and didn\\'t I buy the virus software, and I protected. And that\\'s just, I mean that\\'s just, it\\'s never been reality and\\nit\\'s certainly not that now. So Secure by design\\nreally is one of the ways in which it helps to sort of provide some base backstopping and while we\\'re working to sort\\nof upskill an entire sector and train a new generation of people who are gonna deliver these services and to be able to do that work. And that\\'s one of the roles that the industry can play\\nin really helping this out. - Awesome. Yeah. And so\\na second recommendation was around having customer\\nresponsibility matrix and simplified instructions as part of a product\\'s\\noffering and implementation. - Yeah.\\n- So Leah, could you talk a little bit more about why we thought this was an\\nimportant recommendation? - Oh, absolutely. We hear this often from our\\nparticipating governments because when they are going through that procurement process, or they\\'re implementing a new technology, especially if it\\'s gone\\nthrough something like, oh, it\\'s StateRAMP authorized or it has this certification, we understand there\\'s a\\nshared responsibility there. So even if it comes out of\\nthe box with some of these, Secure by Default features\\neven through implementation or just not knowing better, we might be turning those\\noff or on, as you mentioned. - Right,\\n- And so part of it was something that was very important that we were hearing quite\\noften from our members. And so when we updated our most recent security\\nrequirements for our program, we actually included a page\\nwithin that security package that providers are submitting that includes a shared\\nresponsibility matrix. And so you know which controls then are responsible for that government entity who\\'s purchasing it. And so the way our program works, providers have the ability\\nto provision access to their government customers\\nto have that documentation, but they could also\\njust take that one page. And that\\'s something I\\'ve been, after we had the conversation, I\\'m like, we should pull\\nthat out of the workbook and actually make it\\nits own standing thing because I think it\\'s so important. It\\'s part of the education around this is a shared responsibility. And that\\'s the other\\nthing that I love about, I was thinking the\\neducation that you\\'re doing on the individual level of just, hey, I\\'m a person, I\\nneed to be responsible and think about my own cyber hygiene, or the PSA work that\\'s\\nhappening from CISA, just generally around\\nbeing more cyber aware. But we all have a role in cybersecurity and I think we\\'re all just realizing it. And still, we were talking earlier too, a lot of times you go to\\nan organization and say, who owns cybersecurity? You get a little above this. Because we\\'re trying\\nto figure it out still, what exactly is my role\\nin my organization? And so I think that the more we can do to help drive that conversation\\nand awareness, the better, which is why that shared\\nresponsibility matrix is so important. - Awesome. And one of\\nthe final recommendations that we have in that blog is around industry\\ncontributing time and resource- - Yeah.\\n- To high risk communities. So Trevor, I know that\\nyou alluded to it earlier, but could you talk a little bit about some of the resources that\\nare on CISAS\\'s webpage and how industry can plug into those? - Yeah, so we\\'ve had a good success with some of our private industry partners and helping like offer their resources. If anyone out there is familiar with Project Galileo from CloudFlare, Authenticate, a company they\\nhave a product called Silo that they have offered up a part of that for civil society, which by the way is a program\\nthat they did not have with their company\\nbefore we talked to them. They heard about this work and thought it was in\\neveryone\\'s best interest that they had something\\nthat they could offer. Yubico has been a great partner. They have a really good\\nprogram for their YubiKeys for helping people with the\\nmultifactor authentication, especially using a hardware token, which is very important, especially for these organizations that need really good security, that\\'s just a really powerful tool. And I look forward to working with any other company out there that thinks that they have a good product that they would like featured on our page. We\\'re still open for business,\\nso you can reach out. - Awesome. And then the one final thing I\\'ll highlight on our webpage is our cyber volunteer resource center. So how many of you know about cyber volunteer resource clinics? Yeah, so not that many, right? So there\\'s a movement across the country, both at universities, and at kind of the state and local level, where organizations are creating what are called cyber volunteer clinics. And on the university side, basically they take their\\nthird and fourth year students and connect them with organizations that are under resourced and help them to do kind of\\ncyber hygiene assessments, which is really cool. It\\'s a great way to upskill the future cyber talent pipeline while also providing resources to under-resourced organizations. And then there\\'s also organizations like the Cyber Peace Institute, which draw on the expertise of industry. And so industry partners\\ncan be virtual CISOs for a lot of these\\nunder-resourced organizations, which is really cool. So that\\'s like another way that industry can kind of give back to the target rich, cyber poor community, which is really great. And there\\'s a webpage on CISA.gov where you can learn more about cyber volunteer programs in your area. So yeah, that\\'s just another resource that I wanted to highlight. So I think we have a couple\\nof minutes left for Q and A. So if there anybody has a question, all they can line up. But while we\\'re waiting for that, I have one final question\\nfor all of you, which is, and I know this puts all of\\nyou on the spot a little bit, but if there\\'s one thing that you\\'d like the audience to take away from today\\'s\\nconversation, what would it be? And Trevor, I\\'ll start with you. - I would say that as an industry, I think we have a responsibility to start making these products more secure and easier for the user,\\nhave better education, and look for things that may be an optional\\nsetting in your product that doesn\\'t really need to be an option. Is it something that should\\njust be secure, period? Take a little bit of the\\nburden off of the users on them trying to figure out\\nhow to secure your product and just make it safe for them. - Awesome. Over to you Lance. - I have two things. - Okay.\\n- I would say that really for government and industry, help us make the case that civil society is critical infrastructure\\nthat needs protecting. So the NetHope members,\\nwe only have 65 members, but those 65 members work in 190 countries and serve over 1.6 billion people with three quarters of\\na million employees, with hundreds of thousands of volunteers. All of which are involved in helping deliver critical services that are saving lives, educating children, providing critical care and on and on, and for everything you can imagine. If this is not critical\\ninfrastructure, what is? And we need to be doing\\nmore to protect that and including that in the calculus. And I would say the second\\nthing that I would just say is that really this is also\\nfor government and industry, we do need your convening, we need your product, we need\\nyour talent and expertise, but we do need money. It takes money for civil\\nsociety organizations even to manage a product donation. That\\'s time that we have to spend doing something that\\'s in addition to, or on top of existing work. So just bear in mind that\\nwhen nonprofits come to you and they have a look of\\nconflict in their eyes when you\\'re offering them product, it\\'s not \\'cause they\\ndon\\'t want the product, it\\'s because they\\'ve got to spend time, money and resources, people time to manage that product and make sure it gets\\nmatched to where it goes, that is often a pretty\\nlabor intensive exercise. So all the organizations working on this do need money to operate their programs, please don\\'t forget that. And if you can find ways to support that, you\\'ll go a long way. A million dollars in\\nsupport of cybersecurity is high leverage, it will guarantee almost vastly more than a million dollars\\nworth of damage avoided, harm avoided, no matter where you look. We should be the poster child for the big argument for RSA\\nexistence in the first place. And I\\'m hoping that that lands with a willing audience here. - [Emily] And Leah close us out. - I will. We have some questions, so I\\'ll be quick. I was just gonna say, get involved. Help make the case at your\\nlocal level, your state level, with the organizations that you give to and that you\\'re a part of, \\'cause you are the experts and understand the challenges\\nthat everyone\\'s facing. And sometimes the hardest\\nthing that we hear from the IT leaders or\\nthe security leaders at all levels of government is they need help making the case to the public policy leaders, to that city council, the town council, the school board, the\\nright elected leaders who are making these decisions. So help make that case and get involved. - Awesome.\\n- And you can join StateRAMP too. - Sweet. Okay, over to Q and A. - Well I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my\\nheart to all four of you and the resources that you\\'re providing, I\\'m not gonna throw anybody under the bus, but in the county that I live in, there is one CISSP-\\n- Yes. - For the entire county.\\n- That\\'s right. - And when I started doing cybersecurity for small non-profits, small city governments over 10 years ago, there were almost less than\\nno resources available. And I have seen the attacks\\nincrease exponentially in recent years, starting\\nof with 10 years ago, oh, somebody\\'s posing as\\nthe director of a nonprofit on social media to do scams to now endpoint compromise\\ngoing after payroll systems, to BEC attacks against our school district within 12 months of each other, and the list just goes on and on, ransomware of cities and whatnot. So I\\'m just very grateful that those resources are available now and I\\'m excited to try to bring\\nthose back to my community. - Awesome. Alright, so\\nthank you very much. The question I have is more\\nabout managed security services. So is that something that, I mean, you\\'re nailing it, I give you a puppy, you\\ngotta care for the puppy, and operations is, I mean the infrastructure and operations aspect of any sort of, I mean as small as an\\norganization is gonna be, it\\'s gonna have an I/O group, and that is usually about\\n70 to 80% of the time they have no time for projects, and that stifles innovation or the introduction of anything new. Is there any movement towards\\nnot just providing products but also providing the\\nservices to run them? - Well, I can speak to that. We have a saying in NetHope, \"There\\'s sort of free as in\\nbeer and free as in puppy.\" And you can probably tell\\nwhich one is more desirable in the short term and which one\\'s got\\nlonger term consequences. So a lot of the managed\\nservices in a global context are dependent on universal broadband. And so NetHope was for 10\\nyears a USAID prime contractor on a global broadband initiative to help try to bring that in. And that\\'s resulted in a\\nlot more cloud penetration, a lot more ability to offer\\nsome of these services. And the companies are increasingly\\nlooking at these things, there are packages available, there are some deals, and some discounts and things like that. But as the business model has migrated away from standalone software to cloud oriented services, the companies have been a\\nlittle more measured, I guess, in their willingness to give that away and to what degree they\\ngive that away and so on. So it\\'s not a neat clean answer, but the bigger organizations are moving more and more\\nto the managed programs that allow them to operate\\nmore securely in that space. But there\\'s probably\\nmore that could be done philanthropically around that too. - And I guess also, just to add on that from\\nthe CISA perspective, when we were looking at what GCDC could do in this space and where we could add value, one of the things that we heard from a lot of stakeholders is that they really do need that\\nhands-on keyboard support. And so the way that we approached it was really partnering with\\nthe cyber volunteer clinics that can provide some of that\\nhands on keyboard support, but even those have scalability issues. And at one point the idea\\nof kind of creating an MSSP that could support nonprofits\\nwas kind of thrown around. But again, like funding\\nis always a question too. But yeah, I think it really\\njust does highlight that need for the hands-on keyboard support for a lot of these target rich, resource poor organizations. Yeah, go ahead. - Hi, thank you for the panel. My name\\'s Erica, I work at\\nan international NGO, DAI. My question\\'s for Trevor, I was wondering with Project Upskill, if you have any data on the users, like any general types\\nof users that you\\'ve had or which modules have\\nbeen the most popular? - So as a government organization, we aren\\'t really looking\\nto collect information on the users. You know there\\'s legal issues with that. We do work with a lot\\nof other organizations like NetHope and StateRAMP who are able to actually like reach out and work side by side with the users. So while I don\\'t have a\\nsatisfactory answer for you, but I would say when it comes to what you need most out of Project Upskill, what would be most useful\\nfor you, for any user, I think you need to start with what do you use the most and what do you have that maybe you\\'ve never\\neven thought about securing. If you get on the webpage and you go to the Project Upskill page, you\\'ll find several different\\ncategories of information on what to go through. So I would say just get\\ncomfortable with it, it\\'s there for you to learn and I hope it serves you well. And my information is up here. I\\'ll get you my information after this if you want to go through it and then reach back to me and let me know how the\\nexperience was for you. I\\'d love to hear from you. - Okay, thank you.\\n- Yeah, yeah, just to add on to that, Project Upskill is a new resource, and so we are looking for feedback from anyone in the audience on how it could be more\\nuseful of a resource and as we continue to kind\\nof develop the threat model for Project Upskill as well and really understanding from NGOs and the staff at NGOs kind of the threats that they\\'re facing. And then I think just one other thing that we really learned from developing Project Upskill was that CISA is traditionally focused on traditional cybersecurity vulnerabilities, but Project Upskill also touches a lot on kind of like the OSINT based threats that NGOs and high risk communities might be more exposed to\\nthan the average user. So that\\'s definitely something where Trevor had a lot of- - Yeah, I think especially\\nfor something like that, a lot of these organizations, they use social media to\\nget their message out, but that\\'s also a sort of downfall because when we look\\nat what these APTs do, very muchonce they kind\\nof notice an organization, they will go out and\\ndo open source research to get as much information\\nthey can about you that will lead in to their\\nsocial engineering attacks. So having a better secure social media and really managing that presence, knowing your security controls on there, being aware of what information you\\'re putting out there, which you can find some of that in Project Upskill as\\nwell is very important because that is just one\\nof the biggest things that I can say is the data\\nthat you have about yourself and your organization out there. While it is a very good tool to get your nose tso you can go out and do the mission that you want to do, it\\'s also going to be used against you. - Awesome. Well, so I know\\nwe are standing between you and Alicia Keys, so we\\nwon\\'t keep you any longer, but thank you so much for\\nlistening to our panel today and if you have any questions, please feel free to come\\nup to us after the panel.

And everybody instinctively\\nknows that data is valuable, that there\\'s a value to data. For instance, this is the\\ndisclaimer for this session. In this disclaimer, it says that you guys know\\na couple of things, right? Now, in the hypothetical\\ncase that I would ask you now to sign up a paper giving\\nme your name and your email, acknowledging that you read that, you\\'d probably be suspicious. Like, \"Why is he asking me that? Why is he asking...\" If data wasn\\'t valuable,\\nyou won\\'t even be wondering, \"What is he going to do with my data? Where is that data going to end up?\" So we all know that data\\nis intrinsically valuable. The first time I realized this, that was a long time ago, and I\\'m gonna show my age\\ngiving you this story, but it was in 2001, I was\\n10 years out of high school and I wanted to reconnect\\nwith some of my classmates from high school. And back then, 2001, the only place that I\\ncould manage to do that, it was in a websites\\ncalled classmates.com. I don\\'t know if you guys know it, but it\\'s a website where you\\ncan search for your classmates, and then they will show up, right? But if you wanted to\\nactually interact with them, chat with them, or know\\nmore about their lives, photos, or whatever, then you needed to pay, and\\nit was like $20 per year. So it wasn\\'t incredibly expensive. But I never paid, right? It\\'s kind of a mean way, \\'cause you could see them but you have to pay to interact with them. Now, fast forward a few years after that. I moved to a new country. I was working in Ireland, and in the office,\\neverybody was telling me, that was 2005, \"Are you on Facebook?\" I\\'m like, \"Facebook? What\\nis that Facebook thing? I have no idea what Facebook is.\" And so I signed up. I said, \"What is that Facebook thing?\" Well, turns out that on\\nFacebook you can interact, look for your friends, interact with them, and it\\'s for free. You\\'re like, \"Really?\" I mean, I understand that classmates.com has servers, have maintenance. They need to pay, right? They have employees. Facebook, they don\\'t? Of course they do. Who\\'s paying for that staff? My data. So I am the one sharing my username, sharing my history, sharing my friends, my likes, my dislikes, whatever, and with that, that\\'s what paying. My data is worth something. And everybody, everybody realized that. The government has realized\\nthat data is worth something. Corporations, of course, have realized that data is worth something. And guess what? Criminals have also realized\\nthat data is worth something. That\\'s what they\\'re after. They\\'re after our data. This is definitely not\\nworking anymore, right? - [Vincenzo] Not really. Sometimes. Sometimes it works. - [David] So what is your data worth? Your data, that\\'s what\\nwe\\'re going to find out, what kind of, where it pops up and who steals it. The criminals steal it\\nin four different ways. There. So you have RATs, Remote Access Trojans, we have database leaks, but the most popular nowadays is the one at the right-hand\\nside, Infostealer Malware. And we\\'re talking about a malware that, once it infects your PC, then it does, takes their best effort to gather as much\\ninteresting data as it can. So it goes through your browser. For instance, every time that you, in your browser, you use Amazon, probably none of you have to enter your Amazon account anymore, right? It\\'s memorized somewhere\\nin the browser, right? Now, that password, it\\nactually exists somewhere on your hard disk. These infostealers are\\nvery good at locating where those things are, the way they are memorized\\nwithin the browser, retrieving them and then sending them to the malware creator. They do that for credentials, they do that for crypto assets. If you happen to have a bitcoin\\naccount, coin-based account, or the wallet, the crypto wallet there, directly they pick it up and\\nthey send it to the bad guy. And they do that with a number of things. Like, there\\'s many things that the bad guys are interested in. So we tried to enumerate. We took a look at the top 16 infostealers, trying to see what they\\'re interested in, what kind of stuff they\\'re trying to steal from your infected PCs, and we found, well, we tried to characterize\\nthem in five tiers, based on how easy to monetize they are. You can call it, if you guys are in the financial sector, the liquidity of the data, how easy it is to convert data into money. So we make five tiers. We call that data actionability. So if we make a comparison, an analogy, with a stolen or lost wallet, the most actionable, the most liquid asset would be the cash. Immediately, if you lose your wallet, the cash is out immediately. That\\'s money. In the data world, that would\\nbe your crypto currency. Now, if you have any crypto wallet, if they steal it, it\\'s gone. The money, you\\'re not seeing it anymore, those bitcoins are gone,\\ncompletely liquid, 100%, right? That would be tier A. That\\'s the best one. That\\'s what they want, right? Number one. There will be a second\\ntier where they have to put a little bit of effort. It will be like finding a\\ncredit card in a stolen wallet. So it not 100% liquid, you have to have a\\nlittle bit of an effort, but it\\'s not much. I mean, a credit card, it\\'s\\na pretty good asset to steal. In here, it would be the\\nequivalent of web credentials. Web credentials are pretty, pretty nice. If you have, for instance,\\nsomebody\\'s email credentials, then you automatically\\nhave their Facebook, their Twitter, anything else. As long as you know their username, then you can just reset the password and you have all of those, and you can sell them away\\ndirectly, sell them away. If you have an email, then you can give it to spammers and spammers can spam through your email, your email starts sending crap. Straight away. That\\'s very, very easy. So it\\'s relatively simple. It needs a little bit of effort, so it\\'s not immediately monetizable, but it\\'s a pretty nice asset. Tiers C, D and E are a little more crap. Tier C would be the equivalent\\nof your work badge, right? You can do things with it,\\nbut you really need efforts, you really need to put some effort. That would be the equivalent\\nof, say, other credentials, like gaming credential. You can do stuff with\\ngaming credentials, right? You can log in and try to, for instance, find if there are virtual\\nassets in your game and try to sell them away, or steal them, or move them somewhere. We\\'re talking about a level of effort that a criminal might\\nnot want to take, right? It\\'s difficult. D, it\\'s already pretty useless. We\\'re talking about the\\nequivalence of your gym membership, or your Starbucks loyalty card, right? I mean, you have to be very\\ncreative to monetize that. It\\'s not impossible, but\\nit\\'s pretty difficult. That would be the equivalent of an FDB password, for instance. It\\'s not very useful. I mean, yeah, you can get in\\nthrough somebody\\'s FDB server and find some data, but how do you make money out of that? I mean, not easy. And Tier E would be the lowest. The lowest would be,\\nin the wallet analogy, the lint in the wallet. Like, it\\'s just decoration,\\nthe wallet itself. You can\\'t make a lot of money out of that. And that would be, for instance, they sell screenshots, a screenshot of the infected system, or the system report\\nof the infected system, telling you all of the versions\\nof the installed software. How do you make money out of that? It\\'s very, very difficult, really, really difficult. In here, I would add\\nalso your wifi password of your home\\'s router, and it\\'s pretty useless in itself. And I was telling this story\\nto one of my workmates, and he was, he\\'s very conscientious, very thorough, and he was telling me, \"No, David, my password\\'s very important. Wifi is very important.\" I said, \"Yeah, but look, these guys are in the\\nother side of the world. What are they gonna do\\nwith your wifi password? Not a lot. I mean, they would have\\nto go near your home. What for? To steal your internet access? I mean, that sounds like,\\nnot worth it, right?\" So in my opinion wifi would fall into the lint of the\\nwallet, absolutely useless. So what we did is we categorized\\nall those 16 infostealers, trying to see what were the feature set of each one of them,\\nand giving them points, one point for the E tier,\\nand five points for the A, trying to see how many\\npoints they can amass, based on their feature set. And this is what we got. I appreciate it\\'s very small, but in the left, there\\'s\\na list of those 16. For instance, the first one is BlackGuard, the second is Rhadamanthys, based on the feature set, all the way down to Duck Tail. Duck Tail is a piece of crap thing that it only supports web\\ncredentials for Facebook. It only goes against Facebook, which is pretty useless in itself. I mean, if you don\\'t have Facebook, if you\\'re infected by that,\\nyou couldn\\'t give it a crap. It\\'s like, getting nothing. So this is just analyzing the feature set. But that\\'s not the full analysis, because we don\\'t know if\\nany of these 16 programs are any popular among bad guys, right. Bad guys, for all we know, might be favoring one of them, and that would screw the analysis. What we tried to do then is\\ntry to see which ones of these are actually popular, are\\nactually used by criminals. It\\'s very difficult to\\ndiscern based on samples, so we didn\\'t do that, because, you know, what we\\ndetect as Trojan RedLine, somebody else detects as Trojan Agent, and somebody else detects\\nas Trojan Generic. So it was very difficult. So what we did is we went\\nback to the VirusTotal and tried to see dimensions\\nof those programs, trying to see the level of\\nsamples that people were tagging on VirusTotal each of those samples, trying to gauge the\\namount of those samples that there was in the wild. And we got, like, down to six tiers. The top one was RedLine,\\nbut not even close. There was two million mentions on RedLine. And the next one will be\\nLokiBot, Mars and Aurora, with around 200K mentions. That\\'s like one order of\\nmagnitude between the first tier and the second tier, all the way down to the sixth tier, with up to 300 mentions,\\nthat\\'s pretty much nothing. So the last ones, pretty much\\nnobody\\'s talking about them, nobody has seen them, they\\'re not out in the\\nwild in big numbers. They\\'re more for targeted attacks. Now, what we did is we added, we gave scores to each one of\\nthese tiers, from one to six, and we multiplied the scores\\nbefore with these ones. So what we get is a mix\\nbetween actionability and their popularity in the wild. So we got this. Now, whereas before it was BlackGuard, now, of course, RedLine was number one, because it had two million mentions. So now RedLine goes all the\\nway up along with the other... The first five were pretty much on par. We\\'re talking about\\nfinding already the cream, the creme de la creme, the ones that the bad guys favor the most, and that steal the most\\nvaluable kind of data. Now, this is a post-infection. The way we read it, this is\\npost-infection risk matrix. So it\\'s trying to answer two questions. If I was infected by infostealer X, how concerned should I be? Now, if you\\'re infected by RedLine, you should be very concerned, you know. It\\'s pretty much guaranteed that it\\'s taking a lot of\\nstuff, and it\\'s valuable. Now, if I\\'m, on the other\\nhand, infected by Duck Tail, how concerned should I be? Well, you shouldn\\'t be much, right? And there\\'s graduated in the middle, with different scores. So those are the two. This a post-infection risk\\nmatrix for the top 16. Now, yeah, but where does the data go? Where does it pop up once they steal it? What do they do with it, you know? It turns out that the bad guys, what they do is they have\\na number of marketplaces. There\\'s two that are the main ones, but those marketplaces\\nwork kinda like eBay. So they offer data,\\nstolen data, up for sale, and it\\'s up to the criminal who buys it to decide what to get and how to get. Let me show you. I appreciate it\\'s very small screenshots, but otherwise it just, at a glance, you can see that\\nthere\\'s a bunch of stuff. That\\'s one record from the US. There\\'s three records from the US. The last one has a bunch of domains. Those are the domains\\nthat a prospective buyer, a criminal buyer, would be interested in. So there\\'s a lot of, for instance, Amazon.com, or eBay.com, that\\'s a very, very\\ngood one, very big one. That guy, that victim from the US, got all of those stolen. So in their browser\\nthere were memorized all of those passwords for\\nall of those domains, and that\\'s what the criminal\\nwho put it up for sale is trying to sell you. On the right-hand side, it says, \"Buy\". There\\'s a Buy button, and\\nthere\\'s price, it\\'s $10. And there\\'s also a breakdown of a folder, telling you what kind of assets there are. There are passwords. There are also the\\nscreenshot. Again, useless. And there\\'s a few things, you know. Not only the passwords, but they give you, if there is a crypto wallet,\\nit would be there shown, saying, \"There is a crypto wallet here.\" But you can\\'t actually search for it. You can search for crypto wallets, but you can\\'t search for everything. They\\'re very much geared\\ntowards displaying, indexing and selling domains. So if you, up there in the search box, say, \"Amazon.com in the US,\" it will give you a number of victims that have Amazon.com credentials stolen. And you can get them for\\nabout 10 bucks apiece. And you can, along with Amazon.com, if the guy had a lot more\\ncredentials stored on the browser, you\\'d get all of them, all of them as a package. Now, it\\'s up to the buyer,\\nto the criminal buyer, to judge whether they can make\\n10 bucks off of that or not. Like for instance, if I\\'m the\\nbad guy and I see eBay.com, I might think, \"Well, maybe.\" If it\\'s a big seller, a big eBay seller, yeah, I can scam a lot of people, trying to put up\\nimaginary products on eBay and scamming a lot of people. Some of them, I can make\\n10 bucks the second day, that would be no problem. Now, if there\\'s an empty eBay account, hm, you could only get\\nmaybe the Amazon account, maybe you can get a Hotmail\\naccount or a Gmail account. Is that worth $10? It depends. It depends. It\\'s up to the bad guy to gauge whether that\\'s worth it or not. I said that there are two main ones. This is one, and the other one is this one. Again, very big. This is one, only one thing. The first one, I didn\\'t break it down. The second one is the\\nbreakdown, most of the thing. So you see there the\\nbreakdown in the file? It\\'s very similar. They are different websites, but their features are very, very similar. This one, it\\'s from Zambia. And I chose it because it\\'s very clear that this guy is from a university. So there\\'s a University of\\nZambia website credential. There\\'s also ResearchGate.net, so if you\\'re in the academic field you\\'ll notice that\\nResearchGate and Elsevier, they have academic publications, so probably this guy is either\\na student or a professor. So if you look at this\\nand you look at the price, the price is 2.60, $2.60. If the guy, if you can monetize already for $2.60 the email and the access\\nto the university, you can probably make back\\nthe 2.60 pretty quickly. And I would say even that there\\'s other side of\\nthe criminal business who specialized on selling\\naccesses to networks. So if you have a university\\nusername and password, you can already give it to\\nthe guy who sells access, we call it access as a\\nservice, or access brokers, and they would take it, they would take it without any problem, a username and password. It it\\'s a professor, it\\nwill be even more valuable. So straight away you can\\nsee where the data ends up. Now, what\\'s interesting to us is that, did I mention that we haven\\'t\\nlooked before, up until now, is how accessible, how\\neasy to find are the data. Now, we made four tiers here, one for the web credentials. Web credentials are very easy to find, because they\\'re very\\nindexed, very well indexed. So if you go for, \"I want to find Amazon.com, AliExpress.com, eBay.com,\" straightway, very well indexed, very\\nwell shown, very well done. In second place it would\\nbe crypto currency. If you try to find cryptocurrency\\nin those search boxes, it\\'s a little more difficult. It\\'s not so well indexed,\\nbut you can find them. It\\'s not impossible. In third place, it would\\nbe, specifically, Outlook, because one of them has a\\nplace to look for Outlook. So email is pretty easy to find, not as easy as web, but easy to find. Like, it has to be Outlook, it can\\'t be any other kind. So, mm, the fourth one would\\nbe all the other stuff, like screenshots and all that stuff. Now, it\\'s not as easy to find, because you have to go record-by-record, go through the breakdown in the folders and try to find whatever\\nyou\\'re interested in, so it\\'s a lot more difficult. So those, from easier to\\nfind to least easy to find, would be those four tiers, which we can incorporate\\nto the first actionability to see which one of\\nthose are easier to find in the underground. And we got this graph where, pretty much the same, but\\nBlackGuard goes up now, along with Rhadamanthys. Why? Because those are the ones who have the most amount of stolen data that is the easiest to find\\non the marketplace sites. So it\\'s, again, if you look at it from the infostealer\\'s side, right, if you look at it from the column side, of course, crypto wallets\\nare the number one, and website credentials\\nare the number one, but there\\'s no doubt about that. You know, that\\'s going to be\\nthe bottom line of my talk, like, hands down. But in here, you can see how the shift, again, we\\'re seeing more or\\nless the top five, top six, it\\'s pretty stable, it\\'s always the same. It kind of matches with\\nwhat we are seeing. Now, when we looked at these marketplaces, there\\'s one thing that\\ncalled our attention, which is, for every record, it tells you what infostealer stole it, which is super interesting, because we don\\'t have to guess anymore, we don\\'t have to guess at which\\nare the most popular ones. No, we can see straight away which ones are the ones who stole those\\nthings that are up for sale. And in the bottom side, you can see that there\\'s five, only five of them that\\nwere showing up constantly. Actually, there were three, and then the other two,\\nthe two in the bottom, were almost anecdotal,\\nvery, very small numbers. So it was Raccoon, Vidar and RedLine, those are the big ones, the ones that produce the most stuff that pops up on criminal marketplaces. So if we re-do, taking\\ninto account all this data, we re-do only with those five, we can see that the most\\nconcerning one is Vidar, then RedLine, and then Raccoon. The other two are anecdotal, very small. So Vidar, RedLine and\\nRaccoon are the most, the ones who produce the most stolen data, that steal the data the most, that pops up most often\\non criminal marketplaces. That\\'s somethings that\\'s\\nalready a good finding, right? It\\'s like when we talk about infostealers, \"Oh, there are so many! Which ones are used?\" Well, those three. Those three are the ones you, those are the ones who steal the most. And another one, another\\nthing that with it, \\'cause we already had access\\nto these marketplaces, was, you saw the guy, the stolen, the first that I showed\\nyou was from the US, and the second one was from Zambia, so we could see the countries that they were stealing from, right? So we counted how many of\\nthose were from each country. So we made statistics, just to find out. The country that had the most stolen logs, stolen data, was India, followed by Brazil,\\nIndonesia, and the rest. They were all developing countries, right? So we thought, \"Okay, we can\\'t\\nleave the analysis at that. We should check which one\\nof these actually have the most internet users.\" The internet user base is important, because these people have so many people. India is very big, right? So if we take into account that variable, trying to see India versus how many users, internet users are in India, maybe we\\'ll see what are the most\\nconcerning countries, right? And we find completely different stuff. For instance, Portugal\\ngoes number one by far. Like, by far. It only has 56,000 stolen logs\\npopping up on marketplaces, but the internet population\\nis very small, 7.6. It means that there a very large portion of internet users in that\\ncountry, in Portugal, who have their logs stolen,\\ntheir passwords stolen, as opposed to, for instance, India, who have lots of people, so\\nthe percentage is much smaller. So it\\'s logs per million\\nusers is what we use, and if we make it a percentage,\\nPortugal would be the 100%, but the next one would be Brazil, at 50%. So that\\'s how big of a\\nheadstart has Portugal in having their logs stolen. This we did in a more graphical\\nway, would be like this, with Portugal, that\\'s the top five, and then we added some European. And I didn\\'t put the US, because the US was so far down, not a meaningful amount\\nof logs were stolen. It was like 2.16, compared to the 31\\nwhich the first one has. So the US is way, way, way, way down. But it serves to kind of\\ncompare how Europe fares, compared to other developing countries. And Portugal is obviously an outlier, because it\\'s way up there. So that leaves me with a conclusion. There you go. So first conclusion, I mean, I was to that,\\nI\\'ve already mentioned it, crypto is the most monetizable asset. I mean, you lose crypto, it\\'s\\njust money out of your wallet. You lost it. There\\'s no way to see it again. It\\'s like losing cash. And web data is the most often sold asset. It\\'s the most useful, it\\'s the one that pops up the most, and it\\'s the one that we all\\nshould be very concerned about. If you lose your email credentials, you lost your Twitter, you lost your Facebook, you lost your Instagram, you lost your YouTube, you lost everything. So, very concerning. What to do? Well, if you work in a company\\nthat has to do anything with bitcoin or with crypto, protect your crypto assets, like, hardware, if possible. Put them onto a hardware. Don\\'t leave them just hanging around in a text file on your PC, because they\\'ll find it. Like, all of them, without fail, all of them try to find it, except for Duck Tail, which is a Facebook, very specific one. But all of them, they try\\nto find crypto assets. What data? 2FA whenever possible. So if you can, protect it with multiple\\nfactor authentication. If possible, use password managers. So, you\\'re in a corporate environment, having a password manager,\\nnowadays, it\\'s easy. It\\'s cheap, and, you know, you\\'re guaranteed that you\\nhave it encrypted in-house, not in the cloud, so you can control your data environment. And if possible, I mean, it is possible to\\nnot store web credentials in a browser. Lately, my Chrome is\\nasking me my fingerprint or my master password in order to access, so they\\'re getting there, they\\'re trying to put fences to the ability of an infostealer to pick up those encrypted, those credentials stored on the browser. But if possible, do not\\nstore them in the browser. Use a password manager,\\nbecause it\\'s very easy. It\\'s incredibly easy for them to just go and pick up any memorized\\npassword on the browser. And that\\'s all I got for you. Thank you very much. (audience clapping) We have time for... We have plenty of time, so if you have questions,\\nwe\\'d be glad to address it. - [Audience Member] Hi. When you say save crypto in hardware, do you mean like in a thumb drive? - [David] There are devices\\nthat store your crypto wallets in a hardware that it\\'s already encrypted. So that\\'s what I would recommend. So if you put it on a regular hard drive, it\\'s a step up from\\nleaving on the file system, but it\\'s not super, super secure, \\'cause anybody can just, you\\nknow, pick it up and see it. Whereas if it\\'s encrypted\\nin the hardware level, then only you can see it-\\n- Thank you. - [David] whenever you need it. Sure. - [Audience Member] So you mentioned that these accounts are listed that have crypto wallets attached to them. Why would the people running the malware that\\'s stealing these in the first place not just strip off the crypto wallets and take those for themselves, and then, you know, sell\\nthe rest of the credentials, when there\\'s like a, like you said, liquid cash, basically,\\nthere that they could take? Why are they reselling that at a loss for whatever people are\\nwilling to bid for the account? - [Vincenzo] I\\'ll take that. We assume that they do, actually. So when it comes to stealing your data, the assumption is that when\\nthey get the crypto wallets, first of all, they drain it. - [Audience Member] Oh,\\nso they do drain those. Okay. - [Vincenzo] Yeah, so we don\\'t\\nhave the visibility on that, and, you know, again, as a company, we don\\'t indulge in to\\nfinancing criminal activity so we can go and, you know,\\nbuy the samples to check, but the assumption is\\nthat it\\'s fairly easy. You got the crypto wallet\\nor you got the credentials for the application, so you might want to drain it immediately, \\'cause that\\'s immediate cash, and it\\'s gonna be more worth it than the $2.60 you\\'re\\ngonna sell everything else. So yeah, that\\'s the assumption. Might be that for logistic\\nreason or time reason, they might just pack everything and put it on sale immediately, but my reasonable expectation would be that they just resell it, that they just drain the\\nwallet before reselling it. - [David] On the other hand, what we\\'re seeing also\\nis that these people, when they upload new\\nstuff, they upload in bulk. So they upload maybe 2,000\\nrecords, 5,000 records. So there\\'s the possibility that they might just collect\\neverything automatically, create a big lump of data and then just dump it out\\nwithout even looking at it. But we can\\'t know. Again, he\\'s completely right. We can\\'t know, \\'cause we\\ndon\\'t have this ability on that side. We only see what pops\\nup on the marketplaces. - [Audience Member] You only\\nsee the end product. Yeah. Kind of as a follow on to that, if nobody else has a question. I was wondering, do you index\\nthe value per account at all? Like, you have, you know,\\nmetrics that you\\'ve shown of how many per million and whatnot, but, you know, I would imagine that, like, a, you know, credential from the US, even though that\\'s a\\nvery small representation of what you\\'re seeing out there, still on average would be\\nof more worth per account than, say, one from Zambia,\\nor Brazil, or India. Is that a data point that you\\'ve looked at to try and determine the, you know-\\n- The prices. - [Audience Member] The value per account by country, or?\\n- No. We haven\\'t, but that\\'s\\ncertainly a possibility, that those prices, you see the fluctuation in prices was big. So the one in the US worth 10 and the one in Zambia was worth 260. So it might have to do with that. But we haven\\'t done the full analysis, because there were, like,\\nlots and lots of records, and the prices fluctuate. Because it think that the, when the record starts getting old, the prices starting to go down. And you can see-\\n- Kind of as they lose confidence in the, like to hear that the records\\ncan still be exploited. - [David] Yeah. Instead of 10, you can see five and two, and there\\'s a small sale logo underneath. - Okay.\\n- So we have seen that. So it\\'s very difficult\\nto track down those, and we were not interested in that. But it\\'s a good question. - Thank you.\\n- Thank you. - [Vincenzo] Also, you\\nneed to be fairly careful when you\\'re scraping those data points, because these marketplaces are, you know, very wary of people\\ntrying to scrape the data. And so that little\\naccess that we might get to the marketplaces might\\nget revoked immediately if they just hint that we tried to automate\\ngrabbing their pages, for example. Yes.\\n- Any idea why the US was so low on the list? Like, that\\'s kinda surprising. - [Vincenzo] Huge internal populations, compared to, you know, the\\namount of stolen records. That\\'s the biggest surprise factor. Like, when you just see the numbers of, the absolute numbers of sold records, you get a certain image, and you kind of tend to be biased. Like, \"Oh, India getting so\\nmany records,\" and so on. But then the surprise that really happened when you normalize by actual\\nactive internal populations, and you figure it out that, you know, maybe there are countries that should look into it more than, maybe, some third world countries, for example. - [David] That\\'s precisely\\nwhy we normalized it, because we saw India, number one, and, of course, India\\nhas a huge population, so it was like, maybe we do normalize it, we gonna see something different. And actually, we did. Thank you. - Okay?\\n- Okay. We will give you some time back. Thank you.\\n(audience clapping)', 'drive': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jzdjDoFfHfATqUnpGl9-rJbo_YaUoSev'}, {'url': 'https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2024/the%20art%20of%20probable%20test%20with%20ai%20atomic%20red%20team%20and%20threat%20metrics', 'title': 'The ART of Probable: Test with AI, Atomic Red Team, and Threat Metrics', 'date': 'May 09, 2024', 'text': \"Identifying detection gaps is daunting, but it doesn't have to be.

I\\'m Adam Mashinchi,\\nPrincipal Product Manager at CrowdStrike, and I\\'m here with... - [Brian] And I\\'m Brian Donohue, I\\'m the Principal Security\\nSpecialist at Red Canary. And by the way, before we go on, if we have time for questions at the end, you\\'re gonna wanna line\\nup behind these mics and then you can ask us questions\\nusing those microphones. - [Adam] Thank you, I totally forgot to do that.\\n- I know, I got you buddy. - [Adam] All right, this is\\nthe obligatory disclaimer you\\'ve probably seen a number of times. Here it is again. Everybody\\'s had the\\nopportunity to consume it. I\\'m not going to read it to you. All right, let\\'s move on. So this is the alternate\\ntitle of this talk that we thought was too coy to put in the submission, \"Robots absolutely love to make lemonade\" and hopefully this will\\nall become very clear why we called it that here in a second. What are we talking about today? \\'Cause we obviously, you read the thing and maybe you just saw the\\ntitle and they\\'re like, \"Oh that sounds neat.\" This is what we\\'re talking about. This is actually the\\nsequel to last year\\'s talk that we gave maybe in this room, maybe? Or maybe on the other side. - It was on the other side.\\n- Yeah, this over there. And a few of you apparently\\ncame to last year\\'s talk. So thanks for coming back. This is the sequel to last year\\'s talk and we\\'ll talk about last\\nyear\\'s talk in a second. So that makes sense. But what we are trying to do today, is give you all some\\nreally crystalline ideas about actionable intelligence, how to find it and then use that for your detection validation. And the big kicker here is that\\nconvergence of cybersecurity and AI that we\\'re all\\ntalking about this week, which is using AI to synthesize and interact with threat intelligence. And that really is the crux of what we\\'re gonna be\\ntalking about today. But as a great aside, we\\'re gonna find out how to create tests on the fly with AI and create detectors on the fly with AI and hopefully, show you all\\nhow to do this yourselves so you don\\'t have to just\\ntake our word for it, you can actually give it a shot. So last year\\'s talk, we talked\\nabout all sorts of stuff, but last year\\'s talk just as a summary, we itemized the current state of testing and we were focused on TTPs,\\nnot necessarily adversaries and we itemized kind of the difficulties around testing in your\\nenvironment, that red team, blue team purple team engagement. And we said like good, fast, cheap and all the stuff there. And we talked about data\\ntesting versus real adversaries and Brian went into really good detail about the disparity between those things. And then we said, you know, there\\'s some\\nreally great solutions for how you can do good testing using threat intelligence based off of the kinds of things we\\'ve seen. You know, you can get familiar with tools and you can ingest intel and you can prioritize your testing, but at the end, and maybe it was one of\\nthe people who came back, we got a really good question. I know you put the timestamp in there if you wanna look it up later. But we got a great question which is, how should one perform adversary profiling to deduce the most relevant threats? And we gave a very hand wavy\\nanswer to that question, which is just read a bunch\\nof stuff and good luck. And you know, that idea, I think we have your direct quote here. - We do.\\n- Yeah, you wanna read it? - [Brian] Because you just\\nsaid look at everything in aggregate, pick four or five vendors, look at their reports\\nand just sort of pick out all of the commonalities from them and focus on those commonalities \\'cause those are the things\\nthat you\\'re most likely to face. And then I said, this is\\noverwhelming for a human, which kind of leads us to where what we\\'re gonna be talking about today. So a few months ago, our director of like the\\nenablement or detection enablement, he sent me this big long\\nprompt that he had created and he called it the Atomic Tutor. And basically what it did is, just as a little bit of\\nbackground, Atomic Red Team is a free open-source testing framework. It\\'s just a big library of tests that you can use to test your endpoints, test your detection controls\\nand your security controls. So he created this crazy long prompt and basically what you\\'d do,\\nis you\\'d give it the prompt and then you\\'d feed it a YAML\\nfile from Atomic Red Team. So you\\'d pick a test or a technique, feed it the whole YAML file and then it would tutor you, right? So you could ask it questions,\\nit would answer them, it could quiz you on it. And I was like, \"Wow!\\nThis is like a really, really interesting and useful use case for learning about Atomic Red Team.\" And so my first thought was, we should give a talk on this tutor. But as we started to work on it, we kinda came around\\nto a more general tool than a tool that would just\\nteach you about testing, more useful for a wider audience and really, really useful for sort of junior mid-level analysts. Oh, like there it is. - [Adam] That was a good click for you. - [Brian] Yeah, cool. So the one thing I want to\\npreface this all with is like, so we were like let\\'s create a tool that you can use AI, it\\'ll\\nhelp you create tests. But what we realized pretty quickly is like the practice of\\nprioritizing the things that you want to test, like all the work you do to go into that, you would do the same\\nwork if you\\'re trying to figure out security\\ncontrols to prioritize. So like while we\\'re\\ntalking about testing here, like you can apply\\nbasically all of this to, you know, doing detection prioritization or security control prioritization, or threat prioritization. So like the background here is, like defense validation\\nis super important. Everyone should do it. They should make sure their tools are doing what they think they\\'re doing. But in able to do defense validation, you have to have a\\nreally good understanding of threat intelligence and\\nnot just threat intelligence, you have to know your threat model, right? You have to know the threats\\nthat actually matter to you \\'cause otherwise you\\'re gonna\\nspin your wheels thinking and worrying about stuff\\nthat\\'s never gonna be a problem for your organization. And the big problem here, the one that we really wanted to solve is that threat intelligence\\nand threat modeling are overwhelming. So to create a really crude\\npicture of this, right? You\\'ve got all of the intelligence that\\'s available out there, right? But you only really care about that which is relevant to you, so your threat intelligence. And then the small subset of that is whatever things you wanna\\ndo with it at that given time, which in this context are those things that you want to test. But again, it could be detectors you want to build or whatever. So hat tip to my colleague Katie Nichols who created this slide, this very silly slide many years ago, and I use it when I talk\\nabout threat modeling. So think of it this way, the red thing is the\\nstuff you have, right? That\\'s you, the gray thing is them and it\\'s the stuff they\\nwant in your threat model is where these two things come together. But as I was saying before,\\nit is completely overwhelming. Figuring out your threat model is non-trivial in and of itself and we\\'re not really gonna\\ntalk about it that much today, but trying to sort through everything that\\'s available out\\nthere is insane, right? There\\'s blogs, there\\'s the news, there\\'s like alerts and CSA\\nadvisories and stuff like that. There\\'s annual reports, there\\'s people tweeting all the time. You\\'ve got commercial\\nfeeds, you\\'ve got rumors, you\\'ve got super secret email groups that no one ever wants to invite me to. And it\\'s all like way,\\nway too much to consume. Like my theory is that\\nthere are more minutes of security content on the internet than there are minutes in\\nthe average human lifespan. So like there\\'s no way anyone\\ncan consume all of this. And like even beyond that,\\nlike within all of that stuff, there\\'s all these crazy variables, right? Like some things are\\nsensitive that you have, some things aren\\'t, some\\nthings are already secure, some things aren\\'t, like some news articles\\nor research is misleading, there\\'s conflicting information out there. And then there\\'s all of these things that you just simply don\\'t know. So like the first sort of practice that you have to do is kind of think about how can you start to, you know, narrow down all of the stuff\\nthat is available out there? And one of the things that I\\nlearned when we were working on our threat detection report this year, or I guess I always suspected it, but I kind of validated it with data, is like thinking about what actually differentiates\\na company, right? So the threat modeling is\\nbased on this assessment that your company is unique\\nand has unique things about it. And a lot of people start off by thinking about the easy things, like the things that are\\ngonna make me different to an adversary are my industry\\nor the size of my company. But I\\'ve found that those things\\nactually don\\'t really make that much of a difference. And the things that do and these things are affected\\nby industry sometimes, but it\\'s sort of like secondarily. But the things that differentiate\\nyou are the technologies you use and the way\\nyou store and use data. So like we noticed worms\\ntend to target manufacturers, it\\'s not because worms like manufacturers, it\\'s because manufacturers have\\nmore permissive USB policies because they\\'re using legacy devices and things are air-modeling and they have a legit business\\ncase to let people plug, you know, a USB memory\\nstick into a computer. Whereas, a lot of enterprises just simply do not allow\\nyou to do that anymore because of worms have been\\nsuch a problem for so long. The even more obvious one was like, oh look, tech firms are\\nfacing more macOS threats. And it\\'s like, no duh, because tech firms use Mac more than other enterprises in general. And I think of this just to recap as what I call the the fighter\\njet, shoemaker dilemma. So if you make fighter jets,\\nyou need to be really worried about advanced persistent threats. If you make shoes, your threat model is like you need to be worried about like getting arthritis, right? So there\\'s this hit like\\neveryone kind of exists in this spectrum between\\nthese two places, right? If you have no technology,\\nyou\\'ve got no cyber threat model, but everyone pretty much has\\nsome level of technology. And the reason that, you know, the industry stuff doesn\\'t matter so much is \\'cause most threats\\nare opportunistic, right? If like, they\\'re gonna compromise you in whatever way they can. Things like crypto miners and ransomware, like they\\'re not discerning\\nabout who they go after for the most part. If you have vulnerabilities like that are hanging out on\\nthe internet, easily available, they\\'re probably gonna get exploited. And then on the other\\nside of that spectrum, like all of this APT stuff\\nis extremely targeted and hard to plan for and unpredictable. And yet, it\\'s the thing\\nthat if you read through all of these reports gets\\ntalked about very, very often, particularly in the news, which is one of the\\nreasons why like trying to track all this stuff can lead you down like sort of confusing\\nand time-wasting roads. But so generally speaking, the factors that make companies similar are kind of more important\\nin terms of threat modeling than the things that make them different. Which is why I always,\\nalways harp on the importance of prioritizing prevalence\\nwhen you\\'re thinking about how you should like\\nprioritize defensive controls or in this context, you know,\\nyour testing priorities. And the other reason why this\\nis kind of tangentially good is because asset management\\nis really, really hard. And so if you don\\'t have an a\\nhundred percent clear picture of everything that you\\nhave in your environment, then like just thinking\\nabout prevalent things, you\\'re not gonna go wrong there, right? Like you\\'re gonna have a better chance of casting a wider web\\nagainst all the things that are likely to attack you if you focus on common threats\\nand common attack techniques. But, and now we\\'re getting\\nto the meat of this, how do we figure out what prevalent is? Well, you know, we said it before, you just read all the reports, write down the things that\\noccur across them, right? So here\\'s the threat detection report, here\\'s the top threats that\\nRed Canary saw this year, here\\'s the top techniques. Okay cool, that\\'s one input\\nto figure out what it is. Here\\'s the CrowdStrike\\nreport, that\\'s another one. If you have a really good idea of all of the systems you\\nhave across your environment, then this is easy, right? You can just go through and be like, oh, these things aren\\'t relevant me \\'cause we don\\'t use\\nthese, those things are, and it narrows that list down. But again, like it\\'s still, even if you\\'re able to\\nnarrow it down greatly, it can still be very overwhelming. So this brings us back to what\\nwe were talking about before because you know what\\'s really good at sifting through massive\\namounts of data quickly and finding commonalities, AI tools, large language\\nmodels, machine learning, right? So they\\'re really good at taking in a lot of context on finding those similarities and then providing synthesis\\nof that information to sort of like help you\\nfigure out what are the things that are actually common\\nacross all of these reports. And this is precisely what\\nwe set out to do this year is like figure out a\\nway we can leverage AI to make sense of all of this\\ncrazy disparate information that\\'s being thrown at us on\\nthe internet every single day. - [Adam] And it\\'s not lost on us, right? Everything is being hit by the AI hammer. \\'Cause clearly every problem\\nhas an AI nailed, right? And this is what you\\'ve all\\nseen is you either saw talks or went through the expo floor. It\\'s like AI across all the things. But there are some\\nreally fundamental things that AI does really well,\\nparticularly generative AI and those kind of LLMs. And so again, this a\\nmass amount of content, it\\'s really overwhelming and the expectation that any analyst or anybody in this room can comb through all the relevant threat\\nreports being published by all the vendors all the time and then being able to synthesize that. It\\'s just crazy. Now I mentioned before that we have a few prefaces to make here. So first and foremost, we\\'re not AI/LLM experts here. We\\'re just some security folks and we work with\\npractitioners all the time and we are trying to use\\nAI as a means to the end. So if anybody\\'s wants to\\nlearn how to make a model for themselves or something, sorry, that\\'s not what\\nthis conversation\\'s about. And also we have to eat a little crow here about last year\\'s talk. We made fun of AI quite a bit,\\nI think in that presentation \\'cause it was such a\\nbuzzword last year as well. And we had this whole thing where we talked about\\nWestworld for like 20 minutes, it was a thing. This is our kind of apology to everyone because actually it turns\\nout AI is really good at some stuff that we want to do.\\n- I was very dubious last year when it was like very academic and then between then and\\nnow everyone built all these whizzbang neat AI tools and I was like, \"Oh man, they\\'re kind of cool.\" - [Adam] They are, they\\'re pretty cool. And we\\'re gonna show\\nyou how cool they are. And you know, our assumption\\nabout this audience in particular, is that\\nyou\\'re all Infosec-focused, but you aren\\'t necessarily\\npeople who maybe use things like generative AI every day and you\\'ve heard of ChatGPT\\nand all these other things, but like maybe you haven\\'t sat down and stood up at a counter,\\ntried to use it before. So the perspective for\\nus on this conversation is you all are in Infosec\\nin some or another and you want to make your lives easier. And we\\'re gonna talk\\nabout how you can do that and kickstart your threat\\nintel and the synthesis and all the kind of defender\\nthings you may want to do or offensive things. So why is AI so magic for this problem that we were trying to solve? And I know it\\'s kind of, everybody uses magic in the term of AI, but for us like, well, why is it? One, accessibility. Every single person in\\nthis room can use AI. There\\'s so many options now. There\\'s so many vendors\\nand tools and commercial, it\\'s all over the place\\nand a lot of it\\'s free. Like that\\'s key. It\\'s not us talking about some\\nhorrifyingly expensive tool that you need to go out to\\nsome vendor and buy from. Like anybody in this room\\ncould do this right now. And that\\'s a big key and it\\'s so powerful. Even these free tools that\\nyou get for, you know, just you set up on your phone. It\\'s amazing how powerful these things are and they\\'re so flexible and\\nso customizable by design that you can tailor it to your use case in ways that may be unexpected. And unlike a lot of\\ntechnologies that are emerging and moving really quickly,\\nwhat we\\'re finding is things like generative AI is just\\ntrivial to learn to use. And we can attribute that in a lot of ways to, oh, here\\'s a chat box, I know how to use a chat box, right? That kind of user\\ninterface, it\\'s just easy and you don\\'t have to set up docker images or all sorts of wacky stuff\\nlike, it just turnkey. And then the last thing here is a lot of security vendors\\nare now just providing this and it\\'s baked in. You know, you\\'d see here, you know Charlotte AI from CrowdStrike, you just have generative\\nAI baked into the tools that your organization might already have. And so that kind of thing\\nbecoming more and more available to everyone isn\\'t really\\npowerful for our purposes. But, and this is really important, you get from AI what you put into it, and we mean that in multiple senses. So we mean it literally, AI isn\\'t magic, even though they hallucinate sometimes, which we\\'re not gonna get into, but they can\\'t generally\\ncreate net new stuff. There\\'s no net new knowledge\\nthat\\'s being spat out by these AI things. And you really need to\\nfeed it a lot of data, what we\\'re gonna call knowledge\\nfor the rest of this talk. And there are some what are called retrieval\\naugmented generation or RAG capabilities in these\\nthings where they can crawl out and maybe grab a file off the internet or you know, you can give\\nit a specific kind of file that it needs to be pulling\\nfrom on regular basis or a service it needs to use and that can pull in more of that data and information to help\\nits literal knowledge grow. And that could be all sorts of things, data and files and resources\\nand APIs and ya-ya-ya. But you not only get from\\nAI what you put into it from a literal knowledge sense,\\nlike literal data and words, but you also get that\\nfrom a figurative sense. So the questions you ask it,\\nthe prompts you provide it, these things are incredibly important, not just that you\\'re doing it \\'cause obviously it takes two to tango for some of this stuff, but how you phrase your inputs\\nis staggeringly important. And we\\'re gonna give you some examples of that here in a bit. But there\\'s wacky crazy stuff that nobody fully understands yet. For example, they have found that you get better answers\\nfrom a generative AI if you are polite in your prompts. Why? Who knows? I\\'m sure some scientist, probably someone in this room\\ncould explain that to us. I don\\'t understand. Like why is it that if you\\nput please at the beginning of your prompt it will\\ngive you a better answer than if you did not. I don\\'t think we fully\\nunderstand the scope of that and that is one of those\\nweird kind of quick tips that you can hear from us and you\\'re like, \"Oh I wouldn\\'t have\\never thought to do that\" or \"Why that would be beneficial?\" But it is, and we know this \\'cause we\\'ve been trying to\\nwrestle this thing to the ground for a while.\\n- But at the same time and completely counterintuitively, and we\\'ll kinda get into it in a minute, like it also performs better\\nif you\\'re forceful, right? So it\\'s like, there\\'s all\\nthese weird things going on in here that we don\\'t fully understand and the rabbit hole on researching this is incredibly deep. - [Adam] Yes, and it\\'s one of those things that if you try to just do\\neven an entry-level research into well, why does it behave this way? You fall down this scientist rabbit hole and I\\'m not an AI\\nscientist, so it\\'s tricky. Anyway, so let\\'s ground\\nourselves for a moment. What was the goal? What were we trying to set out to do? Use existing threat intel reporting to provide end users with\\nactionable priority lists of threats and threat actors based on the end user\\'s technology stack. And we want you to use this\\nto improve our testing. And in many ways, Brian and I, as people in the information\\nsecurity industry, we\\'ve been, for years,\\ntrying to figure out this like one MITRE attack\\nheat map to rule them all. Obligatory MITRE attack reference. And that has been kind of like, well, what\\'s a good centering point? How could people interact\\nwith their threat model in a really meaningful way? For years, this has been\\nsomething we\\'ve been chasing and it\\'s not really been attainable because of the complexity\\nbehind this information. Well, guess what everybody? We think we might be\\nonto something to solve for that problem. So how did we do the things\\nthat we\\'re about to talk about? It was ridiculously simple to get started. In our case, we just\\nsigned up for ChatGPT Pro and created this thing called a Custom GPT and that gave us three things to focus on in the creation of that. For those of you, again, assuming that nobody in this\\nroom has done this before, there\\'s three things you focus on. One, capital K, Knowledge, this is the literal data\\nor files that you can shove into the GPT that it\\nwill use as part of that, you know, data in to help\\nit grow and understand what it is you\\'re looking for. And there\\'s a 20 file maximum on that just so everybody is aware for now. The next thing that we\\nfocus on is the instructions and this is where we\\'re\\ngonna spend a lot of time. Those are those, the\\nway you phrase something and the kinds of things they, \"Dear AI, I want you to do this\\nunder all circumstances. These are your rules,\\nthat\\'s your instructions...\" and we\\'re gonna talk about that a lot. And then the last one was the way a user, the end person interacting with this thing should communicate with it and that\\'s that whole\\nuse please sometimes. But it was funny is after\\nwe got started signing up and getting our own Custom\\nGPT working was trivial, finding all the threat\\nreports we wanted to use was non-trivial. And it was so non-trivial that we\\'re like, are we gonna have to click\\ninto a million weird ad boxes across every vendor site? It was nuts. Until we stumbled across\\nJacob Wilson\\'s GitHub. - [Brian] I don\\'t know\\nwho are, Jacob Wilson, but like guys, go check this out. It\\'s so thorough that when we\\ntried to feed it to the GPT, it was like too much. - Yeah.\\n- No, no, no. - [Adam] Also do not try to just like get cloned this repository. It is outrageously large \\'cause it\\'s like multiple,\\nlike hundreds of PDFs over multiple git revisions. It\\'s complete bedlam. However, Jacob Wilson, wherever you are, thank you so much for doing\\nthis, so we didn\\'t have to. But back to the point earlier about like threat intel reports,\\nthese are too much for a human to consume in their lifetime. We found that from a data perspective, like we were trying to put a\\nbunch of stuff into our GPT and say, \"Hey we want you to\\nknow about all these reports\" and it\\'s just like, nah, it\\'s too much.\\n- Turns out not for $20 a month, it won\\'t do it. - [Adam] Yeah, and so I mean, it was too much for our AI as well, which it felt really important. And we also stumbled across\\nlike you can only interact with these things for so much before it says that\\'s enough for one day. For $20 a month, you don\\'t\\nget any more talking to me. So there are some limitations\\naround the way we set it up. Oh yeah, so these are the\\nreports that we ended up using for our initial go and\\nI\\'ll let Brian speak to that.\\n- Yeah, so again, we had that 20 report cap. So I went through Jacob\\'s list and I was just like what of\\nthese reports are the ones that I\\'m most familiar with\\nthat I think are the best? And this is the short list I came up with. So we had the Red Canary\\nthreat detection report, which selfishly, I\\'m one\\nof the main authors of, so I, of course, include that. Splunk, we added that because they\\'ve got a really, really good detection\\nengineering focused research team and their annual report\\'s really good. Mandiant, world class incident\\nresponse, which is nice \\'cause it gives you a\\nsubtly different perspective than if you\\'re looking at\\npeople who are doing detection where you would kind of expect them to be seeing things earlier\\nin the intrusion cycle. Mandiant seeing it much later \\'cause they\\'re coming in to do incident response engagements. Obviously, Microsoft\\nliterally, you know, 90% of everyone\\'s work computers are Microsoft so they have more visibility\\nthan basically anybody. Palo Alto Networks, again,\\nanother huge Infosec company that has a really, really\\ngood research and intel team. Same is true for CrowdStrike. Expel is nice because they do like, they incorporate\\nlots of different tools into their service. They have lots of customers,\\nthey\\'re fairly large and they have a really good annual report. The DBIR is obviously,\\nthe industry standard. It has been for like 15 years. Wiz gave us really, really\\nnice cloud visibility across these reports. And then obviously, we\\nincluded Cisco Talos like just because they\\'re probably one of the preeminent\\npublishing intel teams in our industry. - [Adam] So once we gathered up which reports we wanted\\nto use and feed to our AI, we had felt like we had a\\npretty good baseline for, based on our understanding as humans, like this is the kind\\nof mix of information and actionable intelligence\\nmixed with industry insights that we think would be really\\nhelpful for our purposes. Now to make the magic happen, and again, the assumption here is you\\nall are Infosec people, not necessarily generative AI people, there\\'s this concept of prompt engineering and the most like crayon version of this that I can explain it as is, this is iterative improvement\\nof your text-based inputs, kind of the words or language\\nyou feed to this thing in order to get a response. Now one really good\\nillustrative example of that is the way that if you use\\nChatGPT\\'s DALL-E plugin, which DALL-E is an image generation thing inside of ChatGPT, it\\'s again, we don\\'t need to go into specifics of how all the AI things\\nwork, but it\\'s kind of neat. So I fed ChatGPT plus\\nDALL-E a single sentence, please create a sci-fi\\nrepresentation of the term, \"The art of the possible,\" right? Thematically appropriate for RSA. But ChatGPT does something for you after you put in that sentence and hit go, it expands that and does its\\nown kind of prompt engineering. And this huge wall of text here is what it actually fed\\nto the image generator. I gave it a sentence\\nand it expanded on that in order to give me a result that it thinks that I wanted, right? It expanded that out. This whole crazy whole thing of, \"Illustrate a futuristic\\ncityscape where technology and nature harmoniously coexist, demonstrating the concept of the...\" Like it goes on and on on. I didn\\'t tell it to do\\nany of this stuff, right? But this is a really good\\nexample of prompt engineering \\'cause had I written something\\nlike that in the first place, it probably would\\'ve given\\nme something really neat and it would\\'ve expanded further. So you can get some of this\\nprompt engineering stuff for free because they are trying to help make your prompts better. But if you as a human are doing\\nthat and feeding it better and better inputs, better and\\nbetter stuff is gonna happen. Now we did talk to some\\nreally smart AI people in working on this presentation. And there was one lesson\\nwe learned outta the gate that was really, really compelling and it was told to us that we\\nshould think of AI as a child. And this idea of simple verse\\ncomplex instructions, right? This idea of go make a sandwich versus put a slice of bread\\ndown, then put jam on one side, then put the other slice of bread down, put peanut butter on that side. This idea of thinking of an AI as a child who doesn\\'t really fully understand what you want at first\\nglance is important. And there\\'s some really\\nbonkers eccentricities that we stumbled across. For example, we were\\nmaking lists of things that we were telling the AI to do and we were using dash and\\nthen we\\'d write the words and dash like write the\\nwords to make the list. It would just forget stuff in that list. Just be like, huh, nah, everything\\nafter the second bullet, sorry, I don\\'t know anything about that. And then we just swapped it out and we said one dot the same\\nwords, two dot the same words and it\\'s like, oh cool, I\\ngot the whole list this time. Why? I have no idea. But those sorts of weird eccentricities and landmines are things we tripped over, so now you don\\'t have to. Also we learned that giving\\nit sentences isn\\'t great, it just kinda like drifts\\noff every once in a while. But if you give it a list it\\'s like, oh okay, that\\'s fantastic. Ironically, I ended up using\\ndashes in this PowerPoint, which is counterintuitive\\nto the first bullet point we just made about, oops, whatever. And then we tripped over\\nthis really strange thing about forceful language. If you use strong language like should and always in your prompts, it will give you better results. Because however, it\\'s\\nperceiving these sorts of things and the brains and jars that\\nrun in whatever data centers, all this stuff happens in, that strong direct language\\nhas a meaningful impact on the results you get outta\\nthe back of these things. And you wouldn\\'t just assume\\nthat outta the gate, right? This is something you can\\nlearn from our mistakes. And these simple tweaks, they just had a massive\\nimpact on our results. So when we were creating\\ninstructions for this AI that we were working on, we were using like just experimenting and it was highly iterative. We would just sit down and work together and make change after change,\\nafter change, after change to try to get it to do exactly\\nwhat we were expecting. And it was always, I mean,\\nevery time it produces a result it\\'s slightly different. And so that iterative process was tricky. And this is where we tripped over another kind of counterintuitive thing. We were trying to define the\\ngoals of this thing\\'s output. We knew the kind of results\\nwe were expecting to see, but we can only know\\nthose kinds of results because we are, I\\'ll use lowercase, experts in this field, right? And so those kind of goals\\nare creating a meta example about what we expect as\\npractitioners should be there, it required that level of expertise. We had to have a crystalline\\nunderstanding of our goals so that it would meet them and how to use the language\\nthat it was expecting for us to produce that. And again, we tripped over all\\nsorts of wacky eccentricities while we were working with it. Some other tips, if you all\\nare gonna do this yourselves. Old school, like super\\nsimple debugging techniques, work great. So for example, we would\\nput in our instructions in our rules for the generative AI, always begin your response\\nwith the word, Ahoy! As an example. And then we\\'d say, okay,\\nevery time you do this, make a list, then end\\nthat list with two carrots that says that\\'s everything I know. And then end all your responses with something like, \"That\\'s all folks!\" And then a version number\\nthat we would make up. Now this seems really trivial, anybody who\\'s ever done deprogramming, it\\'s like, oh yeah, console outputs. You do that throughout your program to make sure you hit them all. You can do that with AI prompting and you may not have thought of that. But what\\'s really cool is we could tell how much it was understanding\\nour instructions by, it would just drop off certain parts of our little debugging code here. It would not start with ahoy, or it would not do that,\\nthat\\'s all I know thing, or it would stop printing\\nout the version number we were telling it to\\nend every sentence with. And that was telling us\\nthat it was getting lost somewhere in our instructions. So these kind of old school\\ndebugging techniques, they just work great as you\\'re\\ntrying this for yourself. So we got the thing up and running, we kinda learning how to\\nmake it do what we want and then we needed to create a baseline. What is the kind of correct example, request response that we\\nshould expect from this? So we took an example\\norganization that we knew and we applied AI to it and then we said, \"Okay, let\\'s check our results.\" Now here\\'s an example of\\nour first baseline prompt and this is our don\\'t, don\\'t do this. This is what we started with. I am a 500 person employee\\ntechnology startups. Our employees use macOS, we\\nprimarily use AWS, da-da-da-da. When we were feeding it\\nthis as an initial prompt, as our baseline, it would just forget of half\\nthe things in the sentence. It would just like, nope,\\neverything after that I got bored or something and it would just not know. And which was really strange again, we had to wrestle with it for a little bit to be like, well, why is it\\never bringing up the fact that we use GitHub in our response? And I can\\'t explain to you\\nwhy it would forget things midway through the sentence. All we know is when we turned\\nit into a list it did great. It always remembered it every time. - [Brian] We also switched\\nout macOS for Windows \\'cause we were like, I\\'m not\\nsure how much information there is about macOS across all\\nof this library of reports. So it was good to start\\nlike, so the structure of it was important, but the contents of it were important too. Like if you ever really obscure stuff, your results are gonna probably vary because there\\'s gonna be\\nless information available across whatever your knowledge base is about those technologies. So we kinda took a step\\nback and we\\'re like, let\\'s not overcomplicate this. - [Adam] Yeah, if one of your line items in your tech stack is novel group wise, it\\'s just gonna say,\\nI\\'m sorry, I\\'m so sorry. You should just stop, go on. But yeah, that\\'s exactly right. As we were creating these\\nbaseline models, we were like, well, what\\'s something more\\napplicable for everybody? And this was a much better\\nway for it to be itemized and you know, you can go ahead and have it understand more\\nof the items in your list, which was really, really important. And so our initial results, we did all this stuff and\\nwe created a baseline, it was all amazing and then we hit go, and it didn\\'t turn out very\\nwell when we first started. It would just forget stuff\\nand it would ignore things and it was missing certain details. But the biggest problem we had was it just wouldn\\'t use\\nthe knowledge we had fed it. It wouldn\\'t use all those reports\\nwe\\'d shoved into the thing and in particular when we\\nwere first creating this, it wouldn\\'t do it on the\\nfirst time you talk to it. So you\\'d come up to the AI and be like, \"Hey I have 500 people\\nand they all use Windows and all these things...\" And it would be like,\\n\"Cool, here\\'s some stuff.\" And you\\'re like, \"Well,\\nthat\\'s not specific at all.\" And then you\\'d say, \"Please use your knowledge and try again.\" And it would be like, \"Oh I got you.\" And then you\\'d see this\\nlittle loading wheel that\\'d be like, I\\'m\\nsearching my knowledge. Hold on a second. - [Brian] Yeah, when we\\'d\\nsee the purple thing pop up, it\\'d be like immediate dopamine hit. It\\'s working.\\n- Yes, it\\'s working, it\\'s working. But for some reason it\\njust wouldn\\'t do that on the first go. And we had to try a ton of iterations to like force this thing to no, no, no, use your knowledge every\\ntime you generate a response. And it was tricky. We did over 25 some odd iterations of these instructions to get them, I think it was over 35\\nat the end of the day. And we posted them all, we\\'re gonna give a link\\nto them all here in a bit so you could see how we\\nfumbled around in the dark trying to get this thing\\nto do what we want. So our initial results not great, but as we started playing\\ntennis with this thing, we started to figure things out. And you can see off of what we were just talking about\\nearlier, how we got better. But again, even as we got\\nbetter at getting the AI to do what we wanted, we\\nhad to use our expertise to say, \"Oh, you know what? That result was way too general\" or \"That was way too specific,\" or \"You should have\\ncited your sources here, little AI thing.\" Or like, \"Is this really\\nactionable insights? We wanted to be actionable.\" And so we just use our\\nhuman expertise to try to craft those instructions\\nin a more meaningful way. And so being able to, if\\nyou\\'re trying to do what we did and you know nothing about the information security\\nindustry, you might struggle to create those initial instructions. But ultimately, where we kind of landed was this formula over here where we and our instructions that are like the system prompt\\nis another way to call it, is thing number one,\\nyou say your goal colon and then a sentence, \"Dear\\nCustom GPT, this is your goal.\" Then we gave it a numbered\\nlist of, these are your rules. That\\'s where we put our debugging stuff and we would use language\\nlike, \"always do this\" or \"if an input has that, then do this. But if it doesn\\'t have\\nthat, then do this.\" And those were our\\ndebugging statements were, and then at the very end,\\nwe would add a definitions that says, \"Hey, when we\\nsay threat priority list, this is what we expect\\nto see out of that.\" And this was kind of the magic where we made a major breakthrough. And we were cooking once that happened, it was really impressive. And you can see one of\\nour initial outputs here, and, oh, I can read it\\nprobably easier over here, but you know, we said\\ngive us a priority list. You know, oh, here are your\\npriority threats and techniques and ransomware, that\\'s your number one. Here\\'s our analysis and\\nmitigation and detection. And it was really, really impressive, the kinds of things\\nthat it would prioritize based on our analysis. And it really proved that\\nwhat we were trying to do, which is like we just told\\nthis thing a little bit about our tech stack and it spat out a very legitimate prioritization list based on all this industry information. And frankly, it was really cool that it was just able to\\ndo this out of the gate. And once we got it to create\\nthat threat priority list that we\\'ve been spending\\nhours upon hours working on it and crafting to do, then things got really suspiciously easy and we\\'re talking like trivial. So for example, after we got\\nthe result I just showed you where we were like pretty\\nhappy with the threat. We said, okay, one of the things that brought up was process injection. That\\'s something that you know affects your kind of organization\\nand the technology you have. And we literally just typed in a sentence, \"Create a defense validation te...\" Oh, did I jump ahead?\\n- Yeah, no, no, you\\'re good. - [Adam] \"Create a defense validation test for process injection\\nthat I can run locally on my work workstation.\" So we just type that in, hit\\nenter and it spat out this and it\\'s like, oh, I\\ncan help you with that. Here\\'s your preparation, here\\'s the exact command you\\'re gonna run and this is how it\\'s going to work. It was staggering. We didn\\'t tell it anything\\nabout creating tests. Nothing, like we didn\\'t add\\nthat to a system prompt. We didn\\'t tell it, it just knew. And it knew that based off\\nthe kind of information we had fed it off all the threat intel and actionable reporting\\nthat we had found. And we\\'d also fed it Atomic Red\\nTeam and a few other things, but it was incredible without\\nany sort of instruction. We didn\\'t tell it that it needed to give us a preparation\\nstep or an explainer, or how to format its code example, it just did it outta the gate. It was amazing. And we were really fortunate that it understood that immediately. So then we took it a step further. It gave us an example test\\nof something we could copy and paste into a Windows command line. Well, would it give us a\\ndetection analytic command? And then we said please help me create a detection analytic\\nfor process injection. Bang! It spat out what we looked at as ostensibly correct SQL here. And it gave us a whole\\ndescription on the front and backside of that\\nout, how it would work and how you would execute it and what you would expect to see. We didn\\'t tell it to do that. It had no idea that that\\'s\\nwhat we were looking for. And it just did it out of the gate after we\\'d spent all this\\ntime getting it to be really, really good at understanding\\nthreat prioritization. And that\\'s staggering that it could just do\\nthis out of the gate. And I wanna emphasize that point. Like we had no expectations. We thought we were gonna have\\nto do the whole thing again and teach it how to create\\nthese kinds of quick and easy atomic tests, and here\\'s your detection analytic. It just knew how, out of the gate. So when we wrote this slide,\\nwe were feeling real good and everything was\\nworking, it was fantastic. And we said, you know, there\\'s not really a whole lot of shortcomings. Everything was pretty amazing, as after we got it dialed in. It learned from our reports\\nand even though we kind of had a subjective-ish, what\\nare top priority threats based on all this knowledge, it did a good job of creating that. It gave us objective-ish\\ntests and detection analytics. That was really neat. And do we know for sure that\\nall the commands it gave us were gonna work in our environment? Well no, you\\'d have to test that, but it was still a great way to kickstart what you were working on. Now that\\'s what this slide says. So we high-fived and submitted everything and we\\'re feeling real good, and then about a week went by where we didn\\'t touch\\nour Custom GPT at all. And we came back to it and we asked it the same baseline prompt, and things started to go sideways on us. It had forgotten everything\\nwe had talked to it about over all this time and our instructions were just out the window\\nand it didn\\'t work and it wouldn\\'t use its knowledge, and all these things started going wrong. - [Brian] They\\'re still sitting there and we\\'re looking at the\\ninstructions in the GPT console. They\\'re all there, all its knowledge is still uploaded there, but for some reason, it\\'s\\njust not looking at any of it or assessing any of it anymore. - [Adam] And so we started\\nto do some research, it\\'s like what could be going on here? And this is one of the big caveats that we want to express to everybody. Keep in mind that in our case, like we don\\'t control this model. We, you know, are paying ChatGPT to do this sort of thing for us. So they\\'re making\\nchanges in the background and as they push new versions\\nand dump memory of this thing or whatever, like it\\'s out of our control. And so whatever was happening\\nin the background at OpenAI, it broke some of what we were doing and then we kind of\\nwere struggling with it and we did a bunch of iterations and then we left it for a week \\'cause we were frustrated,\\nwe came back again and it\\'s like, ah, no, I\\'m\\nworking now, everything\\'s fine. It was totally baffling for us. And that\\'s a really important takeaway because again, one of the\\nlimitations of us using, you know, free or inexpensive tooling is we don\\'t control any\\nof the background here - [Brian] Reassuringly\\nfor ourselves at least, like we are not the only\\npeople who have noticed this. Like there are deep, deep\\nforums of people complaining about basically the same problem. - [Adam] Yeah, and we looked up, refuses to search its\\nknowledge and found a mountain of people who we\\'re\\nexperiencing the same thing. So for a bit we\\'ve just felt\\nlike, oh, it must be our bad. But no, there was something\\nsystematically happening in this proprietary engine that was different and out of our control. So that leads us to some of the places where this could all be improved. If you all wanna do this\\nfor yourself, for example, like there\\'s all sorts of\\nformatting consistencies in the threat priority that we used and what the bold and whatever. But the big one here is, we think that if you gave what we\\'ve done to real AI experts, if any of you have people\\ninside your organization or if you yourself can\\nstand up a proprietary model and a data center you control and you could feed it\\nthese kind of instructions and system prompts, and productionize it within\\nyour own organization and something that you own\\nand control end to end, that\\'s gonna save you so\\nmuch headache and heartache as you try to make these\\nthings work for you. And again, we have a\\ngeneral framework here that you could use all\\nsorts of non-public reports in your knowledge, right? We just used a bunch of public ones, but you don\\'t have to, if you wanted to recreate what we\\'ve done. And you could add all sorts of\\nstuff to that knowledge base. And another recommendation we\\'d have is if you have a canonical example of what you want in your\\nthreat priority list that all this generative AI stuff loves those kinds of examples. And you can be really discreet about that. And in the future, if you wanted to be more discreet about Atomic Red Team tests or you wanna integrate things like Sigma or Stratus Red Team, it\\nwould be trivial to do that. - [Brian] Also, this\\njust occurred to me now, but pair an editor with\\nwhoever\\'s doing the prompting for the AI model that you\\'re using \\'cause you wanna have really\\nsharp, concise language. So if you can have a data\\nscientist along with someone to sort of help edit if they\\'re\\nnot the strongest writer, it\\'s gonna be super helpful. - [Adam] Absolutely. And so there\\'s all sorts of\\nconfiguration options you have. We\\'ve tried to make the\\nframework of what we generated and the instructions we\\ncreated to be pretty flexible. You could use all the vendor\\nreports from a given year and, you know, private threat intel or whatever you\\'d like to have. And we were very general. We wanted to provide\\nsomething that was convenient as a great learning example\\nfor people like you all who were thinking about doing this. And again, it was that convenience and little to no AI expertise\\nwas required to get started, but you may have a\\ntotally different intent with the kinds of synthesis you want to do for your threat intelligence programs or analyst programs, or learning. And you can be as specific or granular, or general as you want there. So this is our apply slide, everybody has an apply\\nslide here and this is ours. So you any of you can use our, we call it the Infosec\\nCommunity Encyclopedia just \\'cause we needed a name and it turned into a good acronym. And so we\\'ve got some links there. And then if you want to see what we did and the kind of instructions and iterations we went through to try to rack our brains\\nagainst this stuff, we also have a link to that GitHub. And so we recommend that in the next week, you should identify some\\nfolks and team members who would benefit from maybe\\nusing our version of this. If you\\'re struggling with consuming all this kind of threat\\nintelligence information or reports and creating a threat\\nmodel for your organization or prioritizing what kind of threats that you should prioritize, give it a shot and you know, use this to check your assumptions about what you thought your\\nthreat model might be. Because again, it\\'s a pretty\\nhandy tool even though we have kind of mixed results\\nwith it on a given day every once in a while. Then after that, in the\\nnext three months or so, we\\'d recommend you all collect\\nthe threat intelligence you find useful and prepare to use that in a way that works for you. So whether it\\'s a Custom\\nGPT or make your own thing and use your own data scientists, that\\'s a really good way\\nto move forward from there. And we highly recommend\\nin the next six months, pretty much everybody\\nshould be using something like generative AI to level up your staff. There\\'s way too much information out there for any person to consume, the expectations that we\\'d\\nset ourselves for the industry were unrealistic and\\nthinking that we could ingest all this stuff, especially\\nhuman word versions of these things, not just JSON\\nfiles you get from a vendor. There\\'s a lot of it. And you have someone, well, or something that can help you parse this stuff in the form of generative AI. And definitely if you have senior staff who use this stuff every\\nday, ask them for help and give them really\\nexplicit goals that you have. Say we wanna use generative AI to help our team understand\\nthis in a really meaningful way. And obviously, everybody\\ncan benefit from this, but particularly new and junior staff who are trying to learn about\\nthese reports and get started. It\\'s a good jumping off point. And with that, I think we\\'re done. So thanks everybody for coming out. We really appreciate it. - [Brian] Yeah, and if\\nanybody has any questions you can come up to these microphones.\\n- Yeah, we got microphones here.\\n- If you don\\'t wanna ask in front of the crowd, we\\'ll\\nhang out for a few minutes if you wanna ask us personally. - [Adam] Yeah, we\\'ll be\\naround for a bit, so. - [Brian] What\\'s up? (attendee faintly speaking) - [Attendee] This was\\nthe first one, I think that I saw that really\\nsort of tracked the effort of the practitioner to\\nimplement something. Lots of descriptions of the visions of how things can be applied that are very like tangible and exciting, but really appreciated\\njust everything that was covered here. My question is, in addition, when you create a Custom\\nGPT and you feed it, you know, your repo of\\nreports, is there any potential to also feed it something like the full Atomic Red Team database or the, you know, Sigma Rules database or the MITRE Att&ck Framework? - Yeah, we did that.\\n- For Sigma, yeah. I think we crammed Sigma\\ninto it as well, yes. - [Adam] We tried to cram Sigma into it. So because of a file limitation you have to get it all into one file. But what we did, Atomic\\nRed Team in particular, every night it gets parsed\\ninto a single markdown file and we just fed it that. And it\\'s like, oh, this is great. And it was awesome. That\\'s what helps drives its ability to tests exactly like we wanted. And it also knows about all of our tests. So we would do something like, oh, based on your threat model, you have this sort of, you know, cloud injection or something like that and be like, well,\\nhere\\'s the threat report you should look at and here\\'s the citation and also here\\'s the MITRE Att&ck ID and also, here\\'s the Atomic Red Team test and here\\'s a link to it. Have a nice day, and it\\nwould just high-five you and you\\'d be on your way. It was awesome that it does that. - [Attendee] That\\'s awesome, thanks. - [Adam] Thank you, yeah. - [Attendee] Cool, yeah,\\nI don\\'t have a question, but I just wanted to reiterate what the other gentleman said. I have to say this is one of\\nthe best talks I\\'ve been to in the last three days. Very practical, very useful. - Well, thank you.\\n- Thank you. - [Adam] We really appreciate\\nthat kind of feedback. Nobody came up to the mic\\nand said they didn\\'t like it, so that\\'s a good sign. All right.\\n- Believe that in their private when they\\nfill out the questionnaire. - [Adam] Cool, thank you everyone. Oh yeah, you have one more? Yeah. - [Adam] Yeah, Adam, I noticed\\nthat you\\'re from CrowdStrike. - [Adam] Yeah. - [Attendee] I\\'m a CrowdStrike customer. So how are you guys actually using AI to train your CrowdStrike\\nproduct to do better? (attendee faintly speaking) - [Adam] We can\\'t, I will say this. This is meant to be a\\ncompletely vendor-agnostic talk and we\\'re gonna leave it without, and I can talk to you off mic. Perfect, yeah, and you have one something. - [Attendee] Yeah, I just\\nwanted to really quickly say, I came to this because I\\nwas trying to figure out how to use AI over a bunch\\nof threat intel reports. I was trying to parse\\nthrough \\'em all, you know? And we\\'re, I guess Microsoft\\nCopilot trial customer, but not Copilot for security, right? And I just couldn\\'t make\\nit work in it at all. Like, I just couldn\\'t\\nfigure out how to get all those PDFs into it. And then I saw you guys\\ngiving a little, you know, Hey, we did this thing. I\\'m like, oh my God, they\\ndid all the work for me. I can\\'t wait to go. So I just wanted to thank you for that. And then I guess, I\\ndunno if anybody else is, again, vendor-agnostic, but if you\\'re using Copilot, I don\\'t know if you have\\nanybody figured out a way to make this work for it, but I\\'d love to talk to\\nyou afterwards if you did. - Awesome.\\n- Thank you. - [Adam] Thank you, anything else? Anybody else? All right, travel safe everyone. Thank you for your time.\\n- Thank you so much for coming.\\n- Yep.

I steal this joke from (speaking in foreign language), but I will do it in English, of course, so don\\'t worry, don\\'t need Jet Gpt for Google Translate, but we will do this presentation in English. So welcome everybody to\\nthis presentation titled, The Canary in the\\nCoalmine of Cybersecurity. Today, I am standing here at the stage next to almost 30 years of cybersecurity and fraud strategics, Eward Driehuis. And he\\'s also, vice president of fraud engineering at ThreatFabric, wonderful colleague. So let me introduce you to the first difficult Dutch name, Eward Driehuis. - Thank you very much, Jacqueline Nijzink. So say it with me, Jacqueline Nijzink, can you do that? No, no worries, we\\'ll do it for you. Jacqueline, I\\'m actually\\nthe one who should be proud standing here. Jacqueline is an agent of change. She has been in fraud and in operations for a very long time. She\\'s worked in one of the biggest European banks, ABN AMRO. And on top of that, she has run the international program committee for the EFG Fraud Group here at RSA for over five years. So it\\'s my immense pleasure to be presenting together. - Thank you Eward. - Oh yeah.\\n- You had a clicker. - This was my job to click,\\nlet\\'s not forget that. This disclaimer, take two\\nseconds of a look of it. Take a picture of it and read it later. We will dive in. We will dive in. We\\'re talking about the misery that\\'s been going on in the world because criminals are still trying to get our money and the way they\\'re doing that is in various, various capacities and various amounts. To the left, we\\'re seeing\\nan English gentleman called, John Oliver, love him or hate him. I want ask you to raise your fingers. He was talking about pig butchering here. Now, we don\\'t like the\\nterm, pig butchering. You can say it is actually a romance fraud type of scam with a investment scam, cash out variants. Whatever it is, it\\nbrought a lot of attention to this problem, including that the actual scammers themselves often are victims as well, is one of the\\ncomplicating factors of these problems that\\nwe\\'re talking about today. And to the right, we\\'re\\nseeing Miss Liz Nolan, who has been defrauded as well and came in the news in the UK, the BBC reported. But the interesting thing was whereas, the pig butchering one\\nwas almost completely done by social engineering, Ms. Nolan was hit by a\\nmalware called, Anatsa. And the malware was a mobile malware, and that was the actual method in which they could steal 20,000\\npounds out of her account. Scams are a nuisance, but malware is a nuisance as well. In other words, these two might seem very, very similar. They are in fact not, if you\\'re looking at this from a kill chain perspective or from a technological perspective. I\\'ll give you one more example. We heard the other day that a criminal was\\nactually calling a victim up and telling them they\\nwere the bank, right? This is called, bank impersonation fraud. And they said, \"Well, the criminal might actually call you within the next few minutes and tell them they are the bank, but they\\'re not, we are the bank, so we\\'re gonna agree on a safe word here.\" And what do you know? The bank indeed did pick up on that fraud attempt and they did call the victim. And the victim, when\\nthey spoke to the bank, said, \"Well, you\\'re not the bank, you are the scammer and I know this because you don\\'t know\\nthe safe word,\" right? So even if you\\'re doing everything right as a banking or anti-fraud chain, you might still run into losses, misery, and destroyed lives. - Yeah, thanks. And it\\'s very clear, I think that fraud and scams have major,\\nmajor impact on victims. Independent research\\nin the Netherlands show that 70% of the persons\\nthat been victimized have either are depressed\\nor have suicidal thoughts. And that\\'s really hurtful. So I\\'ve got the background like, you know, it\\'s in a financial industry like also, our founders in ThreatFabric and we saw at firsthand what kind of impact it has that if\\npeople get victimized, it\\'s more than only about losses. It\\'s really negatively\\nimpacting people\\'s life, like you all know,\\nprobably have dealt with it from the banking perspective from other organizations, but it really motivates us to protect people from being victimized. And I think it\\'s really\\nimportant to mention that increasingly attacks\\nof social engineering are more supported by technology. - That\\'s absolutely right. And it is this technology that we want to talk about and place front and center for the next few minutes a little bit because this technology is the first canary in the coal mine that we\\'re gonna talk about today. So mobile channels means, mobile threats. That\\'s what\\'s happening out there, right? When 20 years ago, banks were moving into digital channels, web channels, the criminals followed, they created something called,\\ndesktop malware and fraud was the first type of\\nMO they tried, right? And we\\'re seeing now the\\ncriminals are following the societal trend and they\\'re following our users into the mobile channels. It\\'s that simple. And using the same tricks, they\\'re building their C2, they\\'re building their mobile malware, they\\'re trying to infect end devices and they\\'re trying to\\nleverage that to steal money. And what we are seeing is actually a quite an exponential growth in the amount of unique identifiable families that we have spotted. But more than that, we\\nsee the capabilities of these families change as well. So for example, a few years ago, almost no mobile malware\\ndid device takeover. Right now, it\\'s almost a third or even a little bit over a third\\nof the mobile malware that does device takeover, as part of the criminal capabilities. - Yeah. And if we just have a look, a glance about what are the most targeted countries here, we see that\\'s really as a global problem, over 8 billion people can be targeted. The only prerequisite is, that you are active on your mobile. This research shows also that the U.S. is on the rise\\nfrom being the full most targeted country to climbing up to being the second most targeted country. So yeah, I think, for us, it\\'s a key question. Is mobile malware a growing problem? Yes, we think it is. Click, thank you. And a traffic ecosystem has appeared, not only the number of malware families has increased, but also, everything to do with malware, for example, the hosting. Many actors like Eward\\nalso knows, are driven by profits, creativity. So on the left side, you see one of the most impactful\\nmobile malware families. Some of the families have been there for a while or for years even. Like for example, Hydra and Cerebus. Hydra, like Andrew over there knows, it started or we noticed\\nabout Hydra around 2018. And it really has evolved over time to a very powerful device takeover Trojan. Next to that, we see also\\nconsolidation takes place. So many different malware\\nfamilies are now being replaced by a number of big ones. - So Jacqueline, is every important malware group in here? - No, you might have\\ndiscovered it already. There\\'s one missing, very\\nimportant one, it\\'s Anatsa. - Yeah.\\n- And that\\'s really important. - Yeah, Anatsa is one of the most prolific groups out there and like the lady, Ms. Nolan was, you know, targeted by this and lost her savings. They are quite a little bit less noisy. The way we count these\\nthings is by counting samples that we can see in the wild, right? And samples that we see in the wild and the amount of targets that they have, just like regular old school malware, they have config files and these config files\\nhave targets in them. So that\\'s how we count. And apparently, Anatsa is\\na little bit less noisy, might be an indication of a group being a little bit more professional. - Yeah, and next to many\\ndifferent countries, you can also see that many different banks are targeted. So on the right side, you\\nsee a couple of examples. And what are they trying to do those malware families? They mainly have two objectives. The first objective is, to steal data and they use most of the spyware. And the second objective, most important objective is to enforce\\nthe device takeover. And that\\'s by, for example, using remote access\\ntooling and key logging. - So you might ask\\nyourself, \"Well, you know, if this is mobile apps, how do they get in my back pocket? How do they get on my\\ndevice, on my phone?\" Well, interestingly, the most common vector that we see is that criminals will actually create a totally benign app that might be a file\\nmanager or a PDF reader or a phone cleaner. And it will actually do\\nas advertised on the tin. They will put it in The App Store and there will be no\\nreason to mistrust it, other than when you\\'re a\\nmalware researcher such as our researchers, right? Because they might recognize something otherwise, there\\'s no traits that actually give away that this is gonna\\nbe malware in the future. How\\'s that gonna happen? After a few months, they might have an install base of\\n100,000, 200,000 sometimes, then they do a little update and that update will change the device in your back pocket in a backdoor to the criminal C2, right? So that\\'s how they often do it. Another very popular\\nway of going about this is leveraging updates for apps that you often use like Chrome, of course. You know, this is an\\nAndroid game in essence, Android is the most widely used platform for mobile malware, but not the only one. As Jacqueline is gonna explain later. - Yes. - The things they can\\ndo, the functionalities that are being innovated by these innovating criminals\\nare interesting as well. So this is the first one that I wanna highlight is A, an Android 13 and above security bypass that they\\ncan actually execute. So this bypass can actually allow them to open a site channel\\nand the site channel will for example, be\\nused to download updates. Now, this is a very nasty trick because it will allow them to put a benign app in the store and then later on, kind\\nof load the malicious functionality in the app. But there\\'s more worrisome\\nstuff happening as well. Now, who of you uses\\nmultifactor authentication? Can we see? - Ah, it\\'s a big group, Eward, it\\'s good. - There you go, and I\\nwanna applaud the people who did not raise their\\nhands at RSA here, right? Good for you. That\\'s common clean. Well done. But of course, multifactor authentication and biometrics is a valuable tool on that. But they have bypass mechanisms. You know, what they will actually do is, because one of the tricks they use is the accessibility permission on the phone. Accessibility, most of us, you know, lucky for us, have good vision, but some of us have not. And these accessibility\\npermissions allow them to use a phone while being, for example, visually impaired. Also, these permissions\\nwill allow these apps to read screens, but also, to make clicks, for example. And this is what\\'s happening. They will leverage that permission to when you\\'re at the biometric screen to bypass to the fallback mechanism. Fallback mechanisms in biometrics are of course, very useful. If you cut your thumb for example, your fingerprint will not work anymore. And if you are the kind of cook that I am, that will happen a lot, right? So you want that fallback in place, but then, what they will do is, they will kick you to the fallback immediately, you will\\ntype in your pin code and they will seal it using that accessibility permission. Now, they have bypassed your biometrics. - You might think, \"Okay, I already knew that Android is less restrictive,\" and it might be a good\\nthing or a bad thing depending on your viewpoint, of course. But how about iOS? Now, we can see that on iOS functionality is called, Webclips is misused to create fake applications and mimic banking apps and for example, other apps which you are currently doing your finance with. In addition to that,\\nwe see that regulations are pressuring on Apple to open their ecosystem for third parties. So we definitely expect that there will be more methods of getting malicious apps on your\\nphone will be applied or other Apple device. - Yeah, can I see another raise of hands are there already any\\nEuropeans in this room? - Might be, ah.\\n- Well, the other ones can thank us for that regulation opening up the iOS ecosystem to third party app stores. You know, we\\'re not seeing a lot of stuff happening right now, but that regulation is gonna make sure that\\nwe\\'re expecting a lot of new attack factors\\non iOS in the future. And finally, and this is\\nanother worrisome one, just like 20 years ago when stuff started in the fraud era, there are malicious\\ndesktop malware starting to do fraud on web banks and then, they leverage that to move off into other spaces. We are seeing some of this\\nstuff happening as well. Apparently, some APT like organizations are starting to leverage this as well. We\\'re calling it, LightSpy two, and I must credit this where credits due, the initial LightSpy research was not done by ThreatFabric, but by other companies and they had attributed it to APT 41. Now, we can\\'t verify, that\\none thing we can verify is that the group behind these attacks are definitely better funded and better structured because of the stuff\\nthat they\\'re creating. LightSpy two will be deployed as a fake Telegram app. Again, will do as advertised on the tin, but it has the ability to load modules and one of the modules will actually mimic, WeChat. Now WeChat, probably\\nnot a lot of you use it, maybe one or two of you might. It is the Chinese everything app. It\\'s your dating app,\\nit\\'s your banking app and it\\'s your Uber and many\\nmore things all at once. And the thing it\\'s able\\nto do is by mimicking that app, that module\\nwill be able to download all of your payment data directly off of the WeChat backend. Now, why would they do this? They are building these profiles probably on people, that\\'s what we think. And another capability that it has is to open up the microphone and listen in on conversations. Now, anyone of you have seen one of my favorite movies,\\n\"The Dark Knight Rises?\" Yeah. Yeah, was it amazing? I thought so, Christopher Nolan. And at this one given moment, his researcher of Fox, you know, he leverages all the\\nmobile phones in Gotham to form one big surveillance system. Now, this is what they\\'re\\nkind of seem to do with this functionality. We don\\'t exactly know\\nhow they deploy this. You can\\'t find samples\\nof this in The App Store, but let\\'s just say that it would be super easy to deploy by, for example, DNS poisoning, right? And who is good at DNS poisoning? Those might be, let\\'s say, organizations that have full control\\nof all the firewalls in a given country, for example, right? So that\\'s what we\\'re\\ntalking about right here. We are following this space. This is the first one we ever saw and this is a big canary as well. - Talking about canaries, Eward. After hearing all this, you might think, \"Why is this relevant?\" So mobile malware is a trend that everybody should follow. We are here to say that that trend and that threat is here to stay. The threat is not going away. It\\'s going be to be more impactful and it will definitely also impact you. And me and you.\\n- True. - Because if all of that, what we just told you, it sounds eerily familiar to you, might be true, like I said, none of this is really new in a sense\\nbecause all of this has happened on the web channels as well. They were, you know,\\nentrepreneurial criminals, you know, largely Russian-speaking who were actually creating those malwares and doing fraud with it as a first attempt to steal money off of Western banks. But that of course,\\nbranched out very rapidly. The first one we saw was\\nin APT territory, right? But the second one, we all know this one was exactly the same infrastructures, the same criminal groups and the same malwares that were being leveraged for ransomware. The first one was CryptoLocker, and that branched out further\\nand further and further. (indistinct) was a sabotage tool being used in geopolitical context and further on industrial espionage\\nand industrial sabotage, I should say, industrial, those things are all branching out of the same innovations, starting all the way in the back with good old banking fraud. And this is what happened\\njust a few years ago. We\\'ve been tracking this, right, for a few years now, and it\\'s just a small branch out. But now, we\\'re seeing these APTs and this is where we are. So we don\\'t know where this is gonna go. We\\'re not saying this is gonna be a tsunami of misery, but we should all take notice and the fraud people are some of the first to see it. - So there probably some fraud experts in the room, saw some bubbly hands. So I would ask you or any other global team in the world or fraud experts, what keeps you awake at night? You\\'ll probably answer especially are you based in EU, is that impersonation and romance scams are\\nkeeping you up at night. These are the scams\\nwhere you need contextual data and they are really hard to detect only on transactional data. I\\'ve been in the EFG event this week on Tuesday and there you see that the top, they asked the group the same question. It was also impersonation fraud, but it\\'s very specifically more in\\nthe EU than in America. So talking about the EU... Thanks, yeah.\\n- Yeah, got you, got you. - These are European classifications, so be really clear about that. And when we are talking\\nabout romance scams, we also included pig butchering so then you know why the number is 26. So we also noticed that impersonation bank and bank fraud scams,\\nthey are one out of five and the commonality between both of them, like you all know is really putting emotional pressure on the victim. - Yeah. Now, I know Jacqueline,\\nthat the good people at RSA have asked us\\nto give us their slides a few months ago already.\\n- Yes. - So we do have an update of last week and what we do see is\\nthat investment scams are kind of growing and taking over. So we dunno if that\\'s a temporary. So they\\'re kind of taken over as the number one threat worldwide, but for whatever it is, they are scams in essence, social engineering. So this is what the fraud\\npeople are also busy with, even though they\\'re\\nseeing those innovations, they\\'re seeing, you\\nknow, the mobile malwares as a niche new problem that they have. They\\'re all busy fighting this, aren\\'t we? - Yeah, and investment\\nscams are even higher in the U.S. than in Europe.\\n- Exactly, yeah. Listen, don\\'t trust a\\nguy with a banana, right? One of the best red\\nteam I ever met told me, \"Listen, you don\\'t go\\nthrough security gate with a mug or you know,\\ndon\\'t be so mundane.\" What you want to do is hold a banana because everyone trusts\\na guy with a banana. If you\\'re mellow enough to eat a banana, you probably have no ale intent. So that was a big learning for me. And that\\'s the problem\\nwith scams, exactly, right? We\\'re trying to detect bananas in our fraud chains, pressure, manipulation, cheating, charming, how do we do that? How we define that in IOCs and TTPs? This is a big problem. - Yeah, well, you see,\\nfor a long period is that creating less friction for the customer is really important in the\\ncustomer banking journey. But independent research shows that customers currently prioritize safety above convenience. And if that is necessary, create friction because it\\'s still prioritized and it\\'s independent\\nresearcher, not any bank. So that\\'s really important to notice. And from my background\\nas global head of fraud prevention and detection\\nin a big bank in Europe, I can tell that if you detect fraud, your net promoter scholar goes up of 40%. - 40%.\\n- 40%. And I heard from one of\\nthe panelists on Tuesday that if you communicate\\nabout awareness on fraud, your net promoter score goes up with 20%. So I think we can use and leverage on it to really get and remain the trust of our customers in banking industry. - So what you\\'re saying\\nJacqueline, is that doing fraud in the right\\nway has a measurable impact on your brand and reputation. - Definitely.\\n- Right. Well, that\\'s a good takeaway. Well, for us as anti-fraud practitioners, we\\'re being confronted with the reality that we need to be DJs. Fraud people need to be DJs. You know, whether the attacks hype is very much high-tech, like with the mobile malware, you know, or whether it\\'s super low-tech like with social engineering and scams, investment fraud, romance\\nfraud and what have you. They require vastly different methods to do detection. And again, with scams, you\\'re trying to detect bananas. A banana is low-tech and the more low-tech an attack is, the more high-tech your detection approach is gonna need to be. That\\'s the sad reality of it. But now that scams have become such a global problem, everyone knows the numbers won\\'t bore you with it. Tens of millions in the rising, FBI numbers probably all true, whatever it is, they put us in a place where we started to take notice and need to do something. But here\\'s the other thing. As a good DJ knows, no scam is 100% social engineering or 100% high-tech. There\\'s always a little\\nbit of a shade of gray like in that wonderful book or maybe not so wonderful. And that\\'s what it is. You need to combine those things. You kind of need your slider to be able to drag from left to right in order to operate in\\nyour detection chain. - So we have spoken about the problem, the issue, but\\nunfortunately, there are also a couple of complications here. First of all, new\\nregulations causing a shift towards the reimbursement and liability shift towards banks. So that\\'s the first thing, even if the victim authorized the payment. So that\\'s quite interesting what\\'s happening over there. What we also need to consider, if faster payments is either a curse or a blessing. And lastly and not important, a lot of us have been\\nborn in a mobile world, especially the generation, who\\'s going after us, they\\nare born in mobile worlds. And what we see currently is, that we need visibility and data to detect what\\'s happening\\nmalicious on the mobile. And that\\'s really, really key trend and a complication because we are lacking feasibility sometimes. - Yeah, and you\\'re making another very good point I think, Jacqueline, is that the other day there was a piece of research, I believe it was, I am now plugging Deloitte, but it was a Deloitte\\npiece of research that said that Gen Z was actually\\nthree times more likely to fall victim to scams\\nthan the generation of the baby boomers. Did you know that? Did you expect that? Maybe, you read the research. But on the other hand, right, Gen Z doesn\\'t have as much cash on their savings account, right? So it kind of balances out. But if we\\'re talking about actual successful attempts, that\\'s what we\\'re talking about here. - Kill chain. - Well, this places us\\nin the next important discussion, right? When we\\'re talking about\\nlow-tech and high-tech and if we\\'re talking about being proactive in this approach, with\\nthe high-tech attacks, we need threat intelligence to be part of our detection change. So that makes sense. Now, high-tech attacks and the integration of threat intelligence in anti-fraud is already a process in itself. But then we\\'re already seeing in our timelines that some of these problems are starting to spawn off APT like\\nrisks and other worries. And these need to be communicated back to the other side of the house as well. So how do we coordinate this? Now, cyber fraud fusion is by no means, something I invented, as a matter of fact, I see a gentleman sitting there. Hello Senin, you are actually one of the founding fathers of developing and implementing this in a\\nlarge organization, right? So you have more experience\\nin this than I have. But the important thing is, that we cannot look at these processes\\nanymore in isolation. And the second thing is, like with threat intelligence, the strength is often in sharing and we\\'re not sharing enough, if it comes to anti-fraud. What do we need in order to share? A common vocabulary,\\nand we\\'re lacking that. We don\\'t have that, right? Just as MITRE ATT&CK is there. MITRE ATT&CK is amazing,\\nlike for technical attacks, for hacking malware. But we don\\'t have a similar taxonomy for anti-fraud. So that\\'s what we need to have. We need a kill chain, a fraud kill chain. And there\\'s actually many people, practitioners who have developed one, and that is awesome. But we still haven\\'t aligned on this and I\\'m actually happy to say that here at RSA 2024, the first\\nsteps are being taken to align this stuff going forward because it is necessary for the one scam might be fully the victim\\'s own fault. For the other one, a scam might be eligible for reimbursable incident. - And Eward, this goes beyond the internal of a fraud kill chain. Because like a couple of you who have attended the birth last Monday, there was also a need to cooperate across different\\norganizations, governmental, the legal departments, the public departments, Telcos, and the banks. So I think we should extend it beyond the internal fraud kill chain. - I think that is a fantastic point. So let\\'s dive into the\\nnitty-gritty real fast before we allow you to go to the wonderful final act, Alicia Keys. And if you guys want us to hurry up, just say so, okay. I dunno how far over a walk it is, but let\\'s dive in a little bit. What we did is, we mapped out for some of the most prevalent\\nattacks, some of the TTPs that are in there in our fraud kill chain. And what we\\'re seeing right here, what I boxed in yellow,\\nthese are the areas that are most detectable\\nin an anti-fraud chain. Okay, and what we\\'re seeing with the technological attacks, the malware, mobile malware attacks, you have ample opportunity. They are not only measurable,\\nthey are observable. So they can be translated\\ninto a detection chain and that is key. But if we\\'re talking about scams like a romance scam, you\\nwill see for example, in the account access stage, there is virtually no opportunity to see what\\'s going on there. So that limits the detection capability and that\\'s why as I said, low-tech attack types require high-tech to mitigate. - Yeah, three dead canaries, not only one, you saw one on the way here, it was really, really awful. A real one dropped dead on the street while Eward was walking towards this presentation, you can\\'t believe it. And then your presentation\\nis about canaries, but now, we\\'re talking\\nabout even three dead canaries and one sick one. And what are the key takeaways of this presentation? What should it be? First of all, mobile banking means mobile threats and attacks. Second of all, biometrics and endpoint security are circumvented. Third of all, the fraud problem is really extending the cyber and really is getting into a global problem if it\\'s not already there. And fourth, I think it\\'s\\nreally, really important and not underestimates that scams are moving\\nfrom online to mobile. - Yeah. And when I have my monthly discussions with Gardner, this is what they say to me. And this is not bashing them, this is just a reality\\nof what they report. They say the market for mobile security is a few hundred million big. That\\'s crazy in my mind, right? As in comparison to all the other stuff that we\\'re doing, which\\nis tens of billions, is that market so small? Does the industry deem\\nmobile security good enough? I can\\'t believe that. I can\\'t believe that. Because you know, in a few years, already, our kids are\\nonly on their mobile. And your mobile phone is not just a window on the internet like your browser was 20 years ago. It is your identity, it is your finance, it is your family life. It is your personal\\nidentifiable information. It is your everything. And we\\'re deeming mobile\\nsecurity good enough. I cannot believe that. I don\\'t want to believe that. So there\\'s the call to action, right? And I numbered them for you because what can we do? What can you do? What advice would I give you? Let\\'s look at these things. The last time we saw these kinds of criminal disruptions in the ecosystem, it led to things like global ransomware, pandemics and tools being used in geopolitical conflict. You know, the consequences of which we will be dealing with for years and years to come. So right, if you have mobile channels, adopt at least some kind of visibility, strategic or tactical or both on what\\'s gonna happen\\nwith mobile threats. If you have many consumers on mobile, please adopt visibility, right? Visibility is key towards\\nevery good detection system. And if you don\\'t have all this, follow the news or check\\nout our talks every now and then, we\\'ll update you for free. - Our blogs. - The second one, by all means, rules and regulation, we\\'ve only touched base on this very, very shortly because it allows, doesn\\'t it, Mr. Palla right here in the front knows this\\nbetter than anyone. It allows for a complete week of discussions, right? But this is an important space to look at, right? And why don\\'t you already think about what would happen if there would be a reimbursement, a law on scams because this is happening in other parts of the world as we speak. The EU is trying to drag in Telcos and you might think, shouldn\\'t they drag in big tech as well? Let\\'s see how they fare, right? But this is what\\'s happening in other parts of the world. So perform that risk assessment, what would happen and what would that mean for our business and our operation? And finally, if you do\\nrun an anti-fraud system, if you do leverage TI,\\nknow that these things should either be very closely aligned because that will help you tremendously and analyze the benefits of adopting a fusion strategy. Finally, I truly, truly believe, and I\\'m passionate about making this a point for myself and for our company going forward, that we need a common\\nvocabulary on dealing with fraud in order to share because this is a global problem. - Yes. So in summary, it not only requires a network to be the network, but also, you definitely need to have the right data in place. That requires visibility,\\nor mobile threats and fraud indicators. So yeah, Eward and myself would really like to thank you to joining us and there\\'s open floor for Q&A because now the presentation is a wrap. And hopefully, you stay a bit before joining Alicia Keys. (audience applauding) - Thank you. - And if there are any questions, please use the mic. - So Eward, a question for you, what correlation are you seeing between the people who are creating mobile malware and these large organizations that are aggressively doing the scam to consumers? Are you seeing any confluence there between the same people? And I understand that the mobile malware is more of a technical thing and the scam is more of a social engineering thing, but in your research, are\\nyou seeing any linkage between those two at this point? - I think that is a fantastic point because we did see that\\n20 years ago, right? It started out fully automated the attacks and later on went on to\\nbecome way more manual and way more targeted and focused, right? We don\\'t have a lot of evidence that these social engineering groups are usually from different continents than where, let\\'s say, the mobile malware people are from. And we don\\'t have a lot of evidence of play between them. However, like has happened in the past. I do believe it is very logical there is some collaboration going on. I just don\\'t have a lot of evidence and I will believe it is likely, it\\'s going to happen,\\njust don\\'t know when. - Already putting a fake banking websites, of course, you\\'re gonna\\nput up fake banking apps. - Yes. - Every field does it. You start with websites,\\nthey need to apps. - Yeah.\\n- Yeah. - So question about device posture and I am a cybersecurity manager for a credit union of about 14 million members and account takeover is a very big part of what I try to prevent, are there tools like available like mobile app libraries that are kind of digital engineering team could include in the app to sort of detect malware\\nor is that something that you guys have thought about or included? - Yeah. - Because if you\\'ve got the device, if you\\'ve got full\\ncontrol over the device, like even FIDO2, MFA, you own the device so you can get that. - Yeah, I think that is a very fair point. And like I said, the\\nmarket for mobile device security has actually slowed down over the last years, which is in my mind, like I said, is kind of incredible. But I don\\'t build the market, right? What I do know, there\\'s a lot of appetite from our\\ncustomers that we see. We say, \"Hey listen, with\\nthat product of yours, our customers seem better protected than we are, right, so can\\'t we have that?\" So we see that as a sign that the market might be veering up again. And indeed standalone products like mobile EDRs are indeed, they are in our portfolio as well as, they are, I hope becoming more popular again. - Okay, thank you. - Thank you for the question. - Thank you. And if that was all, I wish you a fantastic afternoon with Alicia Keys. - Yes.

Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the very last session\\nor, as another way to put it, we are Alicia Keys's opening act. My name is Charles Blauner. Welcome to CISOs Unchained. The idea behind the session is a\\nlittle bit sort of inspired by the cryptographer's panel, which\\nis always one of my favorite parts of the conference,\\nwhere you have just four smart people talking\\nabout what's top of mind. It's always been difficult for\\nCISOs to do because when you work for a big company, it's\\nhard to speak your mind on something that will be\\non YouTube tomorrow, as this will be. But the four of us have all\\nrecently stepped away from corporate life into our new\\nlives and thus we are unchained and free to speak our minds,\\nwhich is the focus for today. So, let me introduce\\nour esteemed panelists. I'll let them\\nintroduce themselves. Marene? >> MARENE ALLISON: So,\\nthank you, Charles. I'm Marene Allison. You know, I think we're pretty\\nlucky we showed up in clothes today, not pajama pants and\\nt-shirts, right, and flipflops? We're all appropriately dressed. I'm Marene Allison. I recently retired a little\\nover thirteen months ago from Johnson & Johnson. I'm happy to say I'm a\\nnow recovered CISO from a Fortune 10 company. I have also been at Medco, which\\nwas another large healthcare company, Via Telecommunications,\\nA&P Foods, and a bunch of government stuff. So, I'm happy to be here. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Renee? >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: I'm\\nhappy to be here and I see some people in the audience that\\nI've known for a long time. This is my 28th RSA conference. Phew. So - I think that deserves\\nsomething, don't you? And I was a CISO for - so, I've\\nactually been in the industry for about thirty years. That doesn't mean anything\\nbecause there's people that have been in it as long. But I was a CISO for Coca-Cola,\\nTime Warner, Royal Caribbean, and most recently Campbell's. So, I've been actually -\\nI am actually - I heard the word the other day. I now have a\\npost-retirement portfolio. So, I work with startups now and\\nI really pay attention to the customer journey so that people\\nthat actually implement some of these solutions actually are\\ngetting value on day two not, you know, 365 days later. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Tim? >> TIM MCKNIGHT: So,\\nI'm still recovering. I just finished my\\nlast CISO gig at SAP. I've been a five-time CISO,\\nNorthrop Grumman, GE, Fidelity, Thomson Reuters - >> MARENE ALLISON:\\nA slow learner. >> TIM MCKNIGHT:\\nI'm a slow learner. Twenty-three years. FBI agent in my first life. So, I'm very happy to be here\\nwith my friends and colleagues and I'm doing the same thing. I'm now an operating partner\\nwith SYN Ventures, investing only in cybersecurity companies,\\nwhich is a great transition, I would say. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: And as\\nsaid, I'm Charles Blauner, just for point of reference. I first became a CISO in 1997 in\\nJPMorgan and then I was a CISO at Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. So, pretty much twenty-two years\\nas a CISO except for a year as an investment banker. Before we get into things,\\nthough, one of the things that we wanted to do and take a\\nmoment this morning to do is take a moment for Steve. Everyone who was a CISO anywhere\\nin the world or who aspires to be a CISO owes that\\nto this man - damn it. I didn't want to cry. But Steve was, if you didn't\\nknow, the very first CISO. In 1995, Citigroup created the\\ntitle for the very first time. Steve was my boss at JPMorgan\\nand he quit to go and take that job at Citi. He was the kindest\\nman I ever knew. And if you don't understand the\\nimpact he's had, it's - in this industry, none of us\\nwould be here today if it wasn't for Steve. And we all miss him. And Marene, I know you got a\\nchance to meet him through the healthcare ISAC, so. >> MARENE ALLISON: He's kind of\\nmy inspiration, and what I mean by that is we're a group of\\nfailures for retirement. Okay. And so was Steve. But it was because of his\\nlove of cybersecurity. And I met him - worker with him\\nfor five years on the HISAC, the health ISAC as we\\nwere standing that up. So, it truly meant a lot to\\nme and the visionary and the guidance and how relevant he\\nwas up until just a few months before his passing. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Renee? >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: I\\nknew Steve for a long time. He was the most humble, giving\\nindividual, unassuming. I last saw Steve just before\\nCOVID, so in 2020, and I had two people with me that worked\\nfor me at my last job. And we saw him, you know,\\nwalking on the hall floor, and I said, Steve. And I introduced the two\\nindividuals and he took an interest and asked them some\\nquestions and then he kept walking and I just said you\\nwere just in really, in the presence of greatness. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Tim? >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Always\\npositive influence. I mean, I would mostly see him\\nat the conferences, Atlanta and others, and always had time for\\nyou and anyone else, you know, to give that sage advice, you\\nknow, dare I say wisdom that somebody like he had. So, certainly I agree. Just somebody we all should\\nlook up to and appreciate. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Yeah. So, we miss you but now\\nlet's get into things. We're going to start out a\\nlittle slow and timid and then we'll get a little bit more\\nexcitable, sort of like Tina Turner in Proud Mary. I hope I didn't get a copyright\\nstrike for what I just did. But we also want you to engage\\nwith us, and so as much as this is possible, we're going to ask\\nyou to find the mics on the sides and join us\\nin the conversation. This is sort of unstructured. We're each basically going\\nto ask each other questions. And so, Marene, why don't you\\nstart us off while I sit down? >> MARENE ALLISON: Okay.\\nWell, there we go. So, you know, all\\nfour of us are at RSA. We could be in a BarcaLounger. We could be on the beach. We could be doing\\nall sorts of things. So, what is it about\\ncybersecurity that you love so much? >> CHARLES BLAUNER: So, for me\\nthere were sort of two things that I loved a lot about it. One was it was\\njust hard as hell. And for whatever\\nmasochistic reason, I like really hard problems. The other thing to me is that\\nI've always felt that more than other kinds of industries,\\nthis was as much of a community as anything. And I loved being part\\nof that community. I mean - and some of this goes\\nback to Steve and the idea of community and nurturing. I mean, Steve was the leader\\nbehind - it was a group of six of us that created\\nthat FSISAC, all right. And that's about community. These conferences\\nare about community. And so, I'm here because of\\ncommunity and I love cyber because it's hard as hell and\\nthere's this great community. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: I just\\nloved being in this industry. As I said, I've been in\\nit for about thirty years. And so, for me, it was about\\nthinking forward on some level. I mean, there were some basic\\nthings but I remember thinking - I was everybody's first,\\nsecond, third client. I was Kevin Mandean's, I think,\\nthird client or something like that and I made him give\\nme a ride home in his car. >> MARENE ALLISON: We've all\\nbeen Kevin's client, right? >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: We've\\nall been Kevin's clients. But I remember - but here's\\nwhat they did for me. Somebody came to me and said, do\\nyou think you should be testing those websites to see if\\nthey're vulnerable or not? And I thought, what an idea. Maybe we ought to\\ndo some of that. And so, I loved the time that I\\nwas active in the role because I truly believe we kind\\nof built this industry. And the reason I still love it\\nis because I don't think the challenges are going\\naway any time soon. So, they're maybe getting a\\nlittle bit more daunting because I think there's a lot more\\nopportunity for things to be impactful on people's\\nsafety, sense of safety. So, I love just thinking about\\nhow do we continue to evolve and make sure that we're prepared\\nfor whatever comes next. >> MARENE ALLISON: You know,\\nthat question on the websites, I asked my IT organization,\\nhey, do you think we ought to like test these puppies? And they said, nah,\\nwe don't think so. So, the Iranians did\\nand brought it down. So, then we started testing. Hey, Tim, do you want\\nto be a CISO again? >> TIM MCKNIGHT: That's\\na great question. I'm still recovering\\nso I'm not sure I should answer that question. You know, and certainly, the\\nthings - I always say what I've loved about being a CISO and\\nthen I'll transition to the would I do it again. I still remember - my father was\\na doctor and he always said to me, you know, beyond working\\nfor yourself being the greatest thing in the world, it was\\nthe fact that every day was different, right, and\\nyou're always challenged. So, that's what's great about\\ncybersecurity, you know, as an industry, as a role, as a\\nprofession from my perspective. And the team. Right? You can be a competimate every\\nsingle day but still share openly which is very unusual\\nfrom my perspective. So, in terms of\\nwould I do it again? I - dare I say yes? I'm not saying that\\nactually right now. I'm loving what I'm\\ndoing right now. But I think, with the\\nappropriate controls in place and the right practices\\nwhich we should talk about - >> CHARLES BLAUNER:\\nWe will talk about. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: To protect\\nyourself from liability and everything else and really make\\nsure you have your back covered in the role so that you can\\nperform, you know, I always say, as your best athlete in\\nposition, you need to make sure if you're entering\\ninto this space, those things are happening. And people like us have been\\nmentoring others, you know, new CISOs, current CISOs, to advise\\nthem on everything from the contract they're going into, the\\nteam they're going to be working with, the employer they have,\\nthe culture they're going to deal with - >> CHARLES BLAUNER:\\nWe'll come to that. Renee, why don't you\\ntake the next question. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: I'm\\ngoing to ask the next question. So, we actually crowdsourced\\nour questions since we didn't have a moderator. So, people really want to know,\\nwhat does the future of the CISO role look like? Anybody jump in. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Well,\\nI guess I'll jump in. First, I think the role of the\\nCISO is going to evolve in a couple of ways. But most importantly, it'll\\nevolve in that it will crystallize into\\nsomething specific. I think one of the challenges we\\nhave today is the definition of what a CISO is is so different\\nfrom place to place, which opens us up to a lot of\\npotential difficulties. So, I think the future is the\\nCISO is like the CFO or the Chief Compliance Officer\\nin that it's precise. But also in that it's as much as\\npart of the business leadership team as a CFO would be. And so, I think that's\\nthe quick answer to it. >> MARENE ALLISON: Yeah, you\\nknow, I would say that today when you say CISO,\\nit can be everything. You know, it's kind of like soup\\nto nuts and it's everything and the kitchen sink. It's all together and\\nit's not clearly defined. It can be people that are just\\none step out of being Sys Admins or into IT security. And then - but everybody\\nwants a CISO title because that sounds cool. >> CHARLES BLAUNER:\\nNot so much anymore. >> MARENE ALLISON: Until you\\nhave to wear stripes, it's not going to be so cool. But you know, I've seen a lot\\nof my peers over the years. Oh, you know, and I'm going\\nto get privacy and I'm going to get whatever? And I'm like, yeah, good on you. I kind of like to have my lane\\nand I think that's really, as you had said, Charles, I think\\nit's really going to get to it's going to be very\\ndefined like the CFO. You don't see the CFO being - >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nThe marketing officer. >> MARENE ALLISON: The\\nmarketing officer, right? You know, or HR, right? But you will see this come down\\nto a body of work and then see the education things that we'll\\nneed around understanding the P&Ls, right? Can you understand that? Return on investment. The risk. All of those things will become\\nskillsets that will move us - happen to have technical but\\nalso these new skillsets. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: Tim,\\ndo you have anything to add? >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Well, you know,\\nI mean, I'm kind of watching it now, now that I'm\\non the outside. And you're seeing\\nCISO roles grow. They may begin to\\nown infrastructure. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: Right. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Which I\\nthink depends - is good. I think you're\\nright; it depends. I never said there was\\none size fits all for a CISO at any company. It depends on your industry. It depends on the\\ncompany and the culture. I do think, right, you know,\\nI think that the CISOs have a right to make some demands in\\ntheir role, to have certain authorities that are very clear,\\nto do what they need to do. And I'm hoping and, you know,\\ncertainly I - this group wants to help them set themselves up\\nfor success in their roles, because I agree. There's really no other role, I\\nmean, maybe the CFO of a company has as much exposure externally\\nto the government, to marketing the products, you know, to\\nsharing with others in industry. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: To the SEC - >> TIM MCKNIGHT: To the SEC. Yeah. I mean, we just work\\nacross the whole company on every given day. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: I think the\\nother thing that's going to be most important for the CISOs as\\nthey evolve, and then Tim, I'm going to turn to you for the\\nnext question, is the best CISOs are fundamentally going\\nto be businesspeople. And until they fundamentally\\nare businesspeople, it's always going to be a challenge to\\nget a seat at the CEO's table. So, Tim, why don't you\\ntake the next question? >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Yeah, so one\\nother discussion we wanted to have was with the increase in\\nlegislation that's occurring not only here in the US but\\nglobally, do you all see that that is having a positive\\nimpact on the cybersecurity and security industry and for CISOs? >> MARENE ALLISON: So,\\nfor me I say yes and no. Okay. I think that the legislation - >> CHARLES BLAUNER: I love that. >> MARENE ALLISON:\\nYou like that? >> CHARLES BLAUNER:\\nYeah, yes and no. Keep going, but I do like that. Go ahead. >> MARENE ALLISON: Okay. So, and the reason being is that\\nI think for companies - and somebody once said oh, you're\\nin healthcare, you're below the poverty line, and I took\\noffense to that, of course. But what I realized was\\nin healthcare we were. It wasn't until we got the HIPAA\\nregulation and the security rule that we actually raised up. And then at that time,\\nPCI came out and you also had Sarbanes-Oxley. So, all those things came out\\nwhich kind of made you had to raise that boat\\nto at least there. So, legislation\\nhelps the CISO then. But the problem is everybody\\ngets tied around compliance and not security and risk, which\\nhas to have threat in it. And the threat has changed. So, if you look at the\\nthreat and why we put in Sarbanes-Oxley, it was because\\nof financial reporting. And so, that hasn't\\ntotally changed. But our threat, whether it be\\nnation-states or criminal or hacktivists or insider, it is\\nchanging every single minute. And so, we cannot rely on\\nregulation to - we can't sleep at night because\\nthere's good regulation. We need to have good\\nsecurity which is dynamic. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Great. And I will say, having come from\\nbanking, I mean, banking, I think, generally has been viewed\\nas the most advanced of the sectors from a\\nsecurity perspective. In the old days it's because\\nthey were the big targets because the only way to monetize\\ncrime was to steal money. Now there are ways to monetize\\ncrime in lots of other ways. And the banking, it helped that\\nwe were so tightly regulated and that you had these third parties\\ncoming in, the regulators, to actually examine you. And it helped that when the\\nregulators were unhappy, it became a board level issue. >> MARENE ALLISON: Correct. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: I do think\\nwhile the SEC is going around, I mean, things in a bad\\nway, their intent is good. The problem is there isn't,\\nat least from a US legal perspective, a legislative\\nframework to operate in. And so, I would - I mean, I hate\\nsaying this but this is a place where it would be great to have\\nsomeone define good so that there's a well-known target\\nthat we're going after. I would hate government to do it\\nin isolation because it would be a horrifically bad outcome, but\\nthis is where public-private partnership can really be\\neffective in trying to actually get a good outcome\\nfrom a regulatory or legislative perspective. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: The\\nonly thing I would add is that, you know, the law, I think, has\\ndemanded a certain level of transparency about the program\\nnow, and also what the governance mechanisms look like. So, I think that the fact\\nthat boards are also in in the new boat - >> MARENE ALLISON: You have to\\nread those 10Ks, You'd think that all the companies\\nout there doubting the SEC, they have no OT. Because they never\\ntalk about OT risk. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nI - you know what? I actually gave a talk\\nabout this, about the role. So, I actually started reading\\nthe 10Ks for companies in 2022 and 2023. Yeah. And I actually did find a\\ncompany that had OT in it but it took a long time. >> MARENE ALLISON: One\\nout of 1,000, you know. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: Sure. >> MARENE ALLISON: And they've\\nall got OT environments. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nThey do. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: A lot\\nof them do but we're going to move on. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: I got\\nthe two-parter, remember? I got a two-part question. >> CHARLES BLAUNER:\\nYeah, no, but - >> MARENE ALLISON: He gets\\ntwo parts and then we - >> CHARLES BLAUNER: No, but, we\\ncan have a two-parter but I'm also looking at the clock,\\nso I'm going to move us on. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: All\\nright, all right. This is an important one. >> MARENE ALLISON: We'll give\\nit to you, Charles, this time. >> CHARLES BLAUNER:\\nNo, because - >> TIM MCKNIGHT: You\\nwant to be on boards? >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Because\\nI think these tie together. I mean, the reality is part of\\nthis comes down to the role of the board, right? And there's been a debate about\\nwhether there should be security people on the boards or not, and\\nbut the reality is - and we can talk about that - but the\\nreality is the three of us were all successful to a greater or\\nlesser degree in engaging our boards even before they were\\nforced to talk to us, right? And so, I'd like to hear a\\nlittle bit about how you engaged your board but I'd also like you\\neach to tell me what was the dumbest question you ever\\ngot from a board member? >> CHARLES BLAUNER: I'll\\ntell you - I'll go first. My dumbest question: I'm\\nin one of the biggest banks in the world. This is my first board meeting. And my board member asked me\\nabout fraud on his personal credit card and whether the\\nfraud limit really was $25. So - >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Mine was why\\ncan we not go on the offensive and attack the attackers. To which my response was very\\neloquent, you know, explaining why, the legalities of that and\\nthe prosecutions, to which I was told, are you an\\nidiot or a lawyer? To which I said,\\nI'm not a lawyer. There you go. >> MARENE ALLISON: Mine was can\\nI stop the spam that they get in their email box. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: I\\ndidn't - I had nobody ask me a stupid question\\nor a dumb question. I did have a board member ask\\nme after I told them that I was planning to put some\\nsegmentation in the network, and he said, how are\\nyou planning to do that? With software or hardware? Now, he was the only person\\non the board that actually understood cyber, so there were\\n- all the other board members were, like, sucked in their\\nbreath and they waited while I, you know, gave my answer. And as soon as I gave it, he\\nwas like, okay, that's good. And the rest of them could\\nstart breathing again. So. >> CHARLES BLAUNER:\\nSo, but how did you engage - so, you were lucky. Not too many stupid questions. How did you get them\\nto even pay attention? >> MARENE ALLISON: So, one of\\nthe things is that - there are some companies that they knocked\\nand said hey, can you come and talk to us because we want\\nto understand this new area. They're talking about these\\nthings called advanced persistent threats and\\nthey come from China. Can you come talk\\nto us about it? And so, we did that. One of the other ones, you just\\nhad Niloo was the speaker. My company was - at J &\\nJ, they brought her in. McKinsey could see that we were\\nhaving problems, like, engaging. And when I got to J &\\nJ, I'm like, oh crap. There's this like really long\\nhierarchy I'm going to have to get up for them to hear me. But what I - you know, I\\nhave a strong will and I refused to give up. So, I'd get - one quarter I'd\\nget this far and then I'd get the next quarter and then I'd\\nget the next quarter and then I'd get the audience. And I did have a little luck. The CEO and I went to\\nWest Point together and I was an upper classmen. And so - I said, Alex, I\\ndidn't haze you, did I? Please? He said, no, you never did. But one of the things was having\\nthe conversation with him, and then finally one day he said,\\nMarene, come to lunch in the executive dining room. And I want you to know, you will\\nnever eat lunch in the executive dining room even if it's\\nsitting before you, okay? And so, I sat there and talked\\nto him and we had a long discussion and we had both\\nhad the same education at the time at West Point. He said how did\\nyou learn all that? And I looked at him and I go,\\nAlex, how did you become a CEO? How did you learn all that? I said, we took different paths. And so, getting that human\\nresponse to it and then I got invited to the board, and then\\nit was once year and then it was twice a year and then it\\nwas four times a year. And so, you have to just\\nkeep going down the path. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Yeah. And I think the point you made\\nabout building that relationship is really important. So like, Tim and Renee, why\\ndon't you sort of build on that? >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Yeah,\\nI agree with that. I mean, first thing was\\npersonal relationship, right? So, I always demanded that I had\\naccess to board members even at a one-on-one level. I could sit down and\\nhave lunch with them. And because I didn't know if I\\nneeded to take them from first grade education to eighth grade\\nor from eighth grade into high school on the topic, so\\nthat's very important. I think one of the more mature\\nthings we did at one of the companies was the company had\\nwhat they called explorations, which was for executives and\\nboard members to go explore a part of the business for a week. So, we inserted a cyber\\nexploration program for executives and for board members\\nwhich was pretty comprehensive. It was like two days in DC. You visit Homeland Security. You know, you got - you had all\\nthe speakers come in from all the different agencies. And we really bathed\\nthem in the topic. So, that was sort of the\\nhardcore version of getting them to understand or even\\ndemonstrating a hack or, you know, a break-in to one of the\\nproducts that we may have had. So, I'd say that's the far\\nend, more expensive version of doing that. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: It's\\nfunny because I took - again, I've had a few jobs, right. And the board - the last couple\\ntimes, there was somebody on the board that I had worked with\\nbefore at a different company. >> MARENE ALLISON: That's a\\nhuman relationship, right? >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Right. It's human relationships\\nand sometimes you take advantages of it. Marene, why don't you give\\nus your next question? >> MARENE ALLISON: Oh, now I\\nhave to pull it up, Charles. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Yes, you do. >> MARENE ALLISON: Didn't I\\nhave that controversial one that you know? Did you ever feel like you got\\na punch in the gut while being a CISO from a fellow\\nemployee or your company? >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nI'm answering. >> MARENE ALLISON: Okay. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nIt's mine. >> MARENE ALLISON: Go for it. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: So,\\nhonestly it was about 2004 maybe, and I worked for the CIO,\\nand there were four directs and I was one of them. And I thought, well,\\nI'm doing pretty well. I went to a meeting and\\nthere were twenty people in the meeting. One of my peers\\nwas in the meeting. And he literally in front of\\ntwenty people said, you just have no idea what\\nyou're talking about. None. You don't know\\nwhat you're doing. And all I could think of was how\\nrude, you know, and all these thoughts went through my -\\nI mean, he was downright belligerent, all right. And I remember walking\\nout of that meeting. And HR had been in that meeting. The Head of HR was\\nin that meeting. And I said to the Head\\nof HR, did you see that? Did you see his bad behavior? Did you see what happened there? And he said, you know, if\\nyou don't know how to handle yourself in a difficult\\nconversation, perhaps you shouldn't be the CISO\\nfor this company. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Oops. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nAnd I went, uh-oh. So, I thought, oh my goodness. And then talked to my boss. He wasn't in the meeting. I said, you know, I said,\\nI - this is what happened. He said, I'm glad you're coming\\nto see me about it because I was getting ready to fire you. >> MARENE ALLISON: You? >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: Yeah. Well, we won't go there\\neither but you know. >> MARENE ALLISON: Why you? >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nYou act shocked? Okay. So, but he said, look, you've\\ngot to really be able to have these difficult conversations. So, he got me a coach. And there are books and there\\nare courses that you can take. Well, it turns out\\nthis is a hard thing, and not just for women. This is a universal problem. Men can't do it. In fact, I would tell my - the\\nguys who worked for me later on, I'm not going to fight\\nyour battles for you. If you're in a meeting and you\\ncan't make sure that you can handle yourself, don't\\ncome crying to me. But that's - >> MARENE ALLISON: See, I\\nnever had had that problem. I went to West Point and -\\nlike, that was not something. And in the Army, so that\\nwas not really ever - >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nI knew you wouldn't have had that experience. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Live\\nfire going over your head. >> MARENE ALLISON:\\nYeah, no, I was never. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: I remember\\nbeing in - we had a difficult topic about a Windows migration\\nand I remember being - we were very prepared. We had talked to all the\\nbusiness line CIOs before sitting down with the lead guy\\nand the whole management team. But two of the CIOs were really\\nunhappy with each other and so they decided to go to war at\\nthis meeting, using me as the ping-pong ball. And I just got the\\ncrap kicked out of me. And four of my leaders were\\nin that meeting with me. And they asked me afterwards,\\nlike, about it because I wasn't crying or anything. And I had to explain to them\\n- this was actually more of a lesson less for me than for them\\nthat what happened in that room, even though it looked like they\\nwere beating the hell out of me, had nothing to do with me. >> MARENE ALLISON: Right. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: It had to\\ndo with a completely different circumstance and I\\nwas just the vehicle. And so, I think you have to\\nlearn to depersonalize a lot of these situations. And so, Renee, you've got the\\nlast question just given timing and the nature of your question. And I will ask that if anyone\\nin the audience hopefully has questions, that while Renee is\\nbringing her last question up, you go to the mics. And if not, we'll\\njust keep chatting. But there are mics\\nin the two aisles. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: So,\\nsomeone asked - what was the biggest chain or obstacle that\\nyou had to overcome either personally or professionally? >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Okay. I know you had\\none piece of that. So, I mean, for me, one of the\\nmore interesting sort of chains we had operationally was the\\ntension we had between the security organization and\\nthe legal organization. And that tension came up in a\\nlot of different areas, whether it had to do with\\ndisclosure or other things. But the strangest thing, and\\nthis goes back to part of the LinkedIn conversation, it\\nhas to do with this idea of the fear of finding out. And we had this whole program\\nfrom an anti-phishing perspective just like almost all\\nof you do where you hire someone and they just go out looking for\\ncopied websites, and if they're malicious, you go through\\nthe legal process of getting them taken down. It's all standard procedure. But my lawyers went bonkers\\nwhen I wanted to try to do this because there was a side effect,\\nwhich was if we found sites that weren't malicious or were just\\ninfringing on the copyright, now the lawyers had to do\\nsomething about it and they didn't want the work. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nMaking work for others. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: I was making\\nwork for others and they wanted me to stop searching\\nfor the phishing sites. And I said no. And so, yeah, I took another\\nchain of worrying about the lawyers and I just said, no, I'm\\ngoing to just do the right thing and I broke that chain. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: And so,\\nI wanted to answer this because I never thought of\\nnot knowing, you know. It's that fear of finding out. Either you don't want to know\\nwhat it is; you're already underwater and you're already\\noverwhelmed, or, God forbid, that you're probably partially\\nresponsible for whatever that situation existing\\nin the first place. But I don't know\\nhow you don't know. You know. And I don't know how that\\nwould look six months later. And so, I think that's a chain\\nthat I see some people putting them on themselves. And I would say this. Had I not wanted to know what\\nwas on a ship besides, you know, the games and the signage, I\\nnever would have learned that everything that actually is\\nresponsible for that ship, you know, that cruise ship, is\\nreally an OTIT system, you know. And nobody in IT was\\nsupporting that, really. And I thought, you know what? And that's how, you know, we\\nstarted working with the Coast Guard, you know, in the maritime\\nspace was because we recognized that there was a lot of stuff\\nthat can go wrong out in the middle of the ocean. >> TIM MCKNIGHT:\\nIt's a great point. I mean, one thing you\\nsaid was you put your chains on yourself sometimes. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: Yeah. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: So, my\\nreflection is a little bit of that question of when someone\\nsaid something to you but also the self, you know, the chain\\nyou put on yourself was - I'm not going to ruin the East Texas\\ntwang that he said it in but, it was very much like, Tim, I do\\nnot think you understand the power you have as the\\nCISO of this company. And I was a young executive. He was basically was saying,\\nnobody wants to go up against you and you don't realize\\nthat in your decision-making. So, it was sort of one of those\\ntwists, like, you know, actually use the power that you\\nhave within the company to drive the execution. So. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: My\\ncoach actually told me that I couldn't run. She said when you run, the whole\\nbuilding gets unglued when they see you running. >> MARENE ALLISON: And you know,\\none of the things is I started out at West Point where they\\ntold me no, you can't do this. And I stopped listening\\nand I graduated, right? Like, okay, I can do this. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: I mean,\\nyou're not going to brag so I'll just brag for you. You were in the first\\ngraduating class of women at West Point, so. >> MARENE ALLISON: Thank\\nyou for the clarification. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: So,\\nyou're not just at a tough school for women. You're groundbreaking at\\na tough school for women. >> MARENE ALLISON: And then\\nI went into the FBI and they weren't really totally sure of\\nwhat they were going to do, so I kind of grew up with like, stay\\nin my lane of security but if it has security anything in\\nit, it should be in my lane. And so, I just kept going. And you know, in the day it\\nwas, you know, IT security, the systems security, and product\\nsecurity and OT security were like domains that didn't exist. But I didn't see those lines. I said, okay, I'm just\\ngoing to go in there. So, I unchained myself. Now, there's a few business\\nexecutives that probably didn't want me in their\\nstuff and that's okay. But when they ask about who knew\\nwhere, you know, what all the products were and what their\\nconnectivity was at a board meeting, and the president\\nof the division didn't know and didn't have anyone who\\nknew, and is there anybody in the room who knows? And you know, like the little\\nhand that goes like, I do. Well, why do you know? Because I have to secure\\nit if it's connected. And so, those become those -\\nthat goes into the role of the CISO. We have to unchain ourselves\\nfrom what our - the governance or people have told us we're\\nresponsible to we are CISOs and have a requirement. SEC is saying\\nyou're responsible. Move into those areas. People might not like it. They may throw whatever\\nthey can at you. But you're the CISO. Go in. Head up, eyes straight\\nahead, and figure out what it looks like. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: We\\nhave a question over here. So, just say your name\\nquickly and ask away. >> AUDIENCE: Anna Tvishor,\\nFederal Reserve Bank Supervision. What do you think got easier for\\nCISOs over the last ten years? What got more challenging? And how would you\\naddress those challenges? >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Wow. Easier? Did anything get easier? >> MARENE ALLISON: Well, I think\\nthe technology got easier to start looking at all\\nthe technologies. So, on the converse, what got\\nharder was data went everywhere. Because like, when we started,\\nit was all like on an AS400 in the basement, right? Like, here's my data and\\nthere's a RACF on it. It's so cute. But then what happened is let's\\ndo distributed and let's put, you know, servers under people's\\ndesks and all of that, and then we went mobile and then we went\\ncloud and now we're doing this thing and the other thing. But then all of those things put\\ndata in all sorts of different places, which also\\nhelped to create AI. So, it got harder to\\ngo where the data is. But the technology now, I can\\nscan there, I can go there. There's things that I can\\nuse to make GRC tables. I don't have to\\ncalculate it myself. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: I'm going to\\nanswer your question slightly differently because I'm going\\nto say - because yes, what got easier what got harder. I'm going to say the\\nanswer is nothing. Because if you go back to the\\nlate '70s, early '80s, there were two fundamental problems in\\ninformation security, identity management and patch management. All right? We've moved a little bit forward\\nin time and there are two fundamental problems in\\nsecurity, identity management and patch management, all right? The tech stacks that we keep\\nsolving the problems for change but we fundamentally have been\\nsolving the same problem over and over and over again\\nfor generations, not human generations, technology\\ngenerations. Hopefully we're getting smarter\\nat it, and now with data and AI, we'll get some advantages. But regulatory pressure,\\nthe attack on landscapes has never been worse. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Yeah. I believe it all got harder. Period. End of story. Well, only because, I mean,\\nif you look at it, the budget's all increased. The roles, you know, twenty-plus\\nyears ago, all they cared about was patching the system so we\\ndidn't have a worm running across the network\\ntwenty-two years ago. You know? The roles on the teams, you can\\ngo all sorts of directions now as a security professional\\nbecause we've continued to develop GRC and the operations\\ncenters and trust roles and everything else. So, I just think it's all gotten\\na lot harder and the role went from, you know, maybe once a\\nyear with the board if you were lucky to it is the topic of the\\nboard every quarter, if not even ad-hoc, outside of that cycle. So. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nWhat got easier is that we became cool. >> TIM MCKNIGHT:\\nWe are super cool. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Yeah, we're\\nAlicia Keys's opening act. We have a question over here. >> AUDIENCE: Yes, hello. My follow-up to Tim. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Hi, Matthias. >> AUDIENCE: Hi. I also resigned from the\\ncorporate world and we are building a new solution and\\ncame here to verify the value positions is on the spot. And all the conversations\\nand everything I've seen, it validates it. Downsides, we have a\\nlot of vendors and - >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Question. Get right to the question. >> AUDIENCE: You mentioned\\nto the infrastructure. I'm curious about you mentioned\\nthe CISOs require also more infrastructure for them\\nto perform their jobs. Could you elaborate on the type\\nof infrastructure that you would be looking for? >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Yeah,\\nit's a good question. I think what I was saying was\\nsome of the CISOs are getting expanded roles, which includes\\nthe infrastructure side of the house. You guys would agree? >> PANEL MEMBERS: Yes. So, you know, their mandates are\\ngetting bigger in that role, which is - it depends on\\nyour company, it depends on your industry. It's a very good thing for some\\nbecause, and I will say, you know, in my last few roles,\\nyou know, you may have had a traditional CIO. You had your CISO. You may have had\\na cloud ops team. And you had to somehow make all\\nthese teams work really well together on the\\npriority of security. But I'm happy, if you want to\\ngrab me afterwards, and we can have a side bar discussion. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: But I think\\nthat does touch on what you were pointing out that I think that's\\nimportant to bring out is how much of a team sport this is. I know I had a video in my old\\nfusion center of Mike Rogers talking about cyber\\nbeing a team sport. We can't do anything without our\\nIT infrastructure partners, our app dev partners because\\nI know very few CISOs that actually patch anything. We have a question here. >> AUDIENCE: Yeah, so,\\nanyone can answer, all of you can answer. So, risk quantification and\\nhaving a better cyber hygiene is always a difficult talk. So, the topic of cyber budgets. All I want to hear is now\\nthat the threat landscape is increasing, SC0, cyber\\ninsurance, and all, what worked in your life to make\\nthat case for I need more budget for cyber? >> MARENE ALLISON: So, I\\ndon't think it's more budget for cyber. Right? And so, again, I'm going to get\\nback into, oh, do I own patch management or is\\nthat really the CTO? And I think there is a\\nfundamental problem is we as CISOs try to - well,\\nI'm not a CISO anymore. You all try to chain yourself\\nto the SEC rules, that I'm responsible for that. No, no, no. There's a partner. There's a three-letter acronym\\nthat is missing from there. Where's your CIO? Where's your CTO? And on my way out here, I got\\nthe pleasure of stopping and talking to a board,\\nan SEC board in Omaha. And all in my presentation is\\nabout the CIO owns or the CTO owns the configuration that\\ncreates the risk that the CISO needs to articulate, not own. And the ownership is to\\nthe company and that CEO. And is the funding there? So, instead of like running\\nafter the brand-new squirrels that are out there on the CIO\\nfloor, have you looked, asked the question, how\\nmuch legacy is here? Are you running Windows 2003? Do you still have an Inside\\nExchange server set because you've got a company somewhere\\nthat's running on Windows 2003 and you can't go to the cloud? That's where the risk is and\\nthat's where a little bit with - I kind of like took\\noffense with the SEC. And as the CISO, we can't\\nchain ourselves to that. That's a company risk\\nand we've got to continue to articulate it. I'm not passionate\\nabout this at all. >> AUDIENCE: The question\\nwas primarily, how did you articulate that and how did\\nyou help your organization? >> CHARLES BLAUNER: So, I mean,\\nwe did everything from the perspective of what it meant\\nto the business, all right? So, people who worked\\nfor me knew I was a crazy metrics person. I'm a very data oriented person. So, by the time I retired, my\\nmonthly operating deck was four hundred pages long. And I took my leadership team,\\nas much as they may have hated me for it, through\\nit every month. But that four hundred pages\\nturned into two statements when I talked to the board, which\\nwas are we protecting our customers' data and are we\\nensuring the integrity of our critical systems? And that sort of is also tying\\nto how I went and asked for money because I didn't ask for\\nmoney to do this security thing. I asked for money to\\naddress this business risk. And then they could make a\\nchoice without necessarily knowing about the tech stuff,\\nabout whether that risk versus that money they viewed\\nas a good tradeoff. Luckily, if you are - after you\\nget through a year or two, you build up a degree of credibility\\nand they are more trusting of your opinion. The first couple of years,\\nthey may really dig into your opinion, but they'll eventually,\\nif you're successful and you're good at it, they'll\\ntrust your opinion. Any thoughts? >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: I used\\nto focus on what could go wrong here and really have those deep,\\nheart to heart conversations with the business. And if what could go wrong here\\ncould be prevented or could somehow maybe be detected in a\\ntimely manner so that the thing wouldn't get too far out of\\ncontrol, then it was funded. The opposite of that is when\\nsomebody said to me, what if I gave you $5 million more? And that was - that was actually\\nanother scary moment because the CIO was sitting beside me and,\\nfrankly, it's very difficult to get - to do something\\nin a vacuum. I mean, when I was doing\\nmanufacturing, I backfilled manufacturing positions, you\\nknow, so that those people could come and help me on my project. So, it wouldn't have mattered\\neven if I'd gotten more money that year. Those resources weren't\\nnecessarily available to me, you know, so it wouldn't\\nhave really helped me. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: It depends\\non - when we did our budgeting, like if you looked at a project,\\nif the - I actually budgeted for the resources - >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nSo did I. So did I. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: So, I\\nactually would give them the money, give them the human\\ncapital, because you're right, there's only so much change\\nyou can push through a system at any one time. Given time - Val, I\\nsee you over there. You're going to get the last\\nquestion and then I'll ask - >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: Should\\nwe ask what he's going to ask? >> CHARLES BLAUNER: No, I'm\\nscared about - because I know Val can go in a lot\\nof different places. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: I know. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: And then\\nwe'll each do a closing statement and then - >> TIM MCKNIGHT: For one second\\nover here, is, yeah, I mean, I certainly drove a very\\nprogrammatic approach and only talked about the data to\\ndrive the businesses there. And I agree; we're almost always\\nthe impetus for them getting more budget or moving it\\nup in the prioritization for the company. But it was, you know,\\na real sausage-making. My last company, I had\\ntwenty-eight monthly reviews for twenty-eight different\\nbusinesses to go through just things like vulnerability\\nmanagement, patch management, progress against those programs. So, you know, it\\nwas that laborious. >> MARENE ALLISON: All right. Over to Val. >> CHARLES BLAUNER:\\nLast question, Val. >> AUDIENCE: I have so many but\\nthank you again for your time and insights here. I am Valmiki Mukherjee, for\\nthose of you who don't know, Chairman and Founder of\\nCyber Future Foundation. I would not go there\\nbecause that's my question. How do we derisk the CISO job? With the definition of jobs\\nchanging, I think you touched on it a little bit, and you know,\\nwe're trying to define the protection areas for CISO. One of them is the professional\\nand personal liability insurance for the CISOs, which no\\ninsurers or underwriters are willing to write now. So, what do you think would\\ndefine the job of a CISO that gives, you know, reasonable\\nprotection for us and we derisk that job? >> CHARLES BLAUNER: Let's not\\nwrite a document on the stage right now, but I think\\nthe point you're making is important for us. If you take a look at the\\ncurrent SolarWinds case, irrespective of what SolarWinds\\ndid, I think most of us in our community think the focus on\\nTim is a sign of a lack of understanding about the job. And just for your - just to be\\nclear, it has nothing to do with being called a CISO. Whatever the most senior\\nsecurity person is in the company is who they're\\ngoing to care about irrespective of title. Little company, big company,\\ntitle isn't the point. So I think for us,\\nthere are two things. One is we need to sort of derisk\\nit, we need to educate about what the current\\nreality is, right? But then I'll go back to what\\nI talked about earlier about this whole idea of a\\npublic-private partnership. We need to define a definition\\nof due diligence and what good cyber looks like. We need to develop almost\\nlike you would have for a CFO, a form of accreditation. And I'm not talking about yet\\nanother acronym to throw on your thing, but some form of\\naccreditation that ties to the ability to insure an entity. In the meanwhile, if you are\\na CISO and you don't have D&O insurance from your company,\\ngo talk to your boss and get D&O insurance built\\ninto your contract. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK: I\\nhave to add one more thing. What would derisk it would\\nbe knowing how long I could get called back. So, I have to share the\\nstory of being called back. I was subpoenaed four years\\nafter I left my job, all right? So, for derisking, it means that\\nI would sleep a lot better to know that all the companies that\\nI worked for, I couldn't get a subpoena for them tomorrow and\\nsuddenly be testifying on behalf of all of them. So, I don't even know the\\nanswer to that anymore. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: I will give\\ncredit, you know, to Team8, Cynet, many of the law\\nfirms have done a great job of pulling together. And I actually took all of them\\nand I made like a four pager that has everything. I'm happy to send that out so\\nthat you don't have to read all those, all the guidance\\nfor CISOs on how to really protect themselves. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: A lot of\\ndifferent entities have tried to put out some helpful stuff. And folks like Joe Sullivan\\nand others have been talking a lot about it. We're almost out of time so I\\nwant to just ask each of you for a last comment. And so Marene, why don't we\\nstart with you for a last thought for the group? >> MARENE ALLISON: So, the crowd\\nis the future of cybersecurity. You have great potential. There is going to be no\\nguidebook that says this is what the technology is going to\\nlook like in twenty years. You're going to have to continue\\nto learn and grow and come to events like this so you\\ncan learn from your peers. >> RENEE GUTTMANN-STARK:\\nAsk for help. I did it early and often and\\nthe community is always willing to pitch in. >> TIM MCKNIGHT: Similar,\\nseek out mentors. I've been very lucky in my\\ncareer to have some great people take an interest in me and\\nhelp me and give me guidance. And we're all here\\nto help as needed. >> CHARLES BLAUNER: And the\\nI'll just follow that up with an ask which is when you've been\\nlucky enough in your life to have been touched by\\ngood mentors, pay it forward, all right. Find other people to mentor. What we have today\\nis tribal knowledge. Tribal knowledge gets passed\\ndown person to person. So, cherish the people\\nwho mentor you and find people to mentor. And enjoy Alicia Keys.

We\\'ve made it through the entire week and we are at a good point to kind of slow down a little bit\\nand have a conversation. And that\\'s what I wanna\\ndo with you all today is just kind of have a conversation about some of the things that have been extremely passionate to me, infrastructure, device\\nconnectivity, IoT connectivity, how we\\'ve been managing that. And hopefully I can provide\\nsome tips and techniques that you can take away\\nand you can immediately start implementing things back at home or fill in the gaps or just\\nhave some extra thoughts to think about as you\\'re traveling\\nback on your flight home. So let\\'s dive into this. Of course, we have the disclaimer. Y\\'all have seen it like, I\\nmean, how many times already? Network and infrastructure security. So that is my background\\nfor a number of years, number of years, working\\nthrough different network and infrastructure things,\\ninventory management. All of those are the things\\nthat I have passion about, IoT implementations,\\nzero trust strategies. So let\\'s dive into some of the things that we\\'re gonna try to\\neducate ourselves through and just have some understandings about. Is that good for everybody? Yes? All right, good, I got a good crowd today. So I appreciate that. So we\\'re gonna go through and learn how we can talk about discovering things in our different environments and how we can manage through and learn about identifying devices\\nthat are connected to our networks and educate\\nourselves on processes and procedures that allow us to get there. And then at the end of\\nthat, we will, of course, be able to protect our environment because that\\'s what we\\'re\\nall here for, right? To protect our environments,\\nto protect our assets and come up with better techniques to prevent risk in our environment. And so let\\'s dive into\\nsome of these topics. As we look at how we\\nare connecting devices, as we look at things that are of interest, we understand that identifying is one of our biggest challenges, right? We have so many connected devices. We have so many things out\\nthere that are unknown. We just need to have better understanding on how we\\'re going to be able to do that. And so let\\'s have a conversation about what we need to do there. What needs to be prioritized? So we have all these things. I\\'ve now discovered all of these things. Which one is most important? Which process do I need to put first? And we always do that\\n\\'cause we ask ourselves, well, do I need additional resources? Do I need this, that, or other? What does that priority look like? So let\\'s talk about some of those things. Inventory collection. Where are we keeping our inventory? Where are we keeping our docs? Is it consolidated? Do we have some here? Do we have some there? I mean, I know in a number\\nof companies I work for, and this team has a good inventory, this team has a good inventory, this team has a good inventory. None of them are talking to each other. Why is that? We\\'re all working for the same goal. Why can\\'t we do something a\\nlittle bit better on that? Let\\'s figure out how we can do that. And then the reporting is different. Everybody needs to know\\nsomething different from the same data. The operations center, the management, the end user, the developer, everybody has a different\\nneed of the same data. Profiling different devices. You scan a device, you in-map, you do whatever you do,\\nwhatever tools that you use, you bring back information about that. And everybody needs something different about that same data. So let\\'s talk about what\\'s\\nmost important for that. And then when we look\\nat inventory management, are we keeping it protected? Are we putting it in\\nthe right environments? And are we applying the right identities to how we\\'re keeping that data together? So let\\'s dive into some of these things. Manage devices. How do we solve for this? I mean, we all have large and small and mid-sized environments, thousands of devices, hundreds\\nof thousands of devices. I mean, I work for Microsoft. I mean, we got millions of devices. So how do you manage all of that? How do you keep track? You know, when they come back and say, well, how many devices were compromised? Or how many devices are compliant? Or how many? And you say, well, 10\\nmillion are not compliant. What is it? You say, okay. Where do you even start with that? Are they all connected to the environment? How did they connect? Was it through access point? Was it through some wire\\nconnection that you had? How did they get there? Where did you get that information from? What scanner gave you that information about those connected devices? How well are you managing\\nyour unknown systems? We scan devices. We have labs. We have IoT that connects. We have sensors here. We have sensors there. Are we managing those systems well? Do we have processes in place that allow us to automatically account for what we\\'re doing with\\nthese connected devices? Or we say, well, okay, I have this. This space is done. This space is done well,\\nbut that\\'s 10 devices. And I have 100,000 more to deal with. I need to be all encompassing. I need to create systems\\nthat cross not just my team, but all the other teams\\nthat are in my ecosystem. And we\\'re all taking logs. I mean, everybody has a SIM, right? I mean, let me see your hands. Who doesn\\'t have a SIM? If you don\\'t have a SIM\\nin your environment, raise your hand. If you are managing your SIM\\nvery well, raise your hand. Exactly. Nobody raised their hand\\nbecause they get so overwhelmed. It\\'s like, I can\\'t, you know, it\\'s false negative, false positives. How many falses do we talk\\nabout every single time? And then the storage gets, you know, I\\'m increasing my storage \\'cause I have more connected devices, but I don\\'t have identity\\nfor all those devices. I don\\'t have a threat risk rating for the devices I have\\nconnected in my environment. It\\'s just overwhelming. And so you start making choices, right? You start making decisions\\non what you\\'re gonna look at, what you feel is most important. And that goes back to that prioritization. What\\'s most important? And so when we look at this, and we look at our different scenarios, and we say, I have a large inventory. I have a ton of IOT. Does anybody have any\\nIOT in their environment? Nobody, just a few people? A few people raised their\\nhand, like 90% of you. Everybody has IOT today. And guess what? It\\'s gonna grow. The more you get sensors that do this, and sensors that do that, and devices that do this, and automation that does that. And I like walking into the hotel and the shades just come up. Don\\'t y\\'all like that? Shades just automatically,\\nthat\\'s all your IOT. It\\'s all connected. Do you have accountability\\nfor all of that? Because if you don\\'t know where it is, it\\'s like bees to the honey. Your hackers are just looking for it, and waiting for it, and\\nwaiting for you to mess up, and waiting for you to not\\nmanage passwords on it, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. And so when we look at our IOT systems, are we managing the\\nphysical aspects of it well? We\\'re managing it \\'cause we installed it, but are we managing it well? Do we have good controls\\naround who can access it, who can get to it, who can modify it? When you\\'re walking around the halls here and you see the access points\\nthat are sitting behind a trash can or something, it\\'s a means to an end, but\\nI would suffice it to say that most of our networks\\nare not having access points so easily accessible to anyone passing by. Sensors, all of these different things. So you just need to be mindful of that. And then when we\\'re looking at quantum, I\\'m really keen on quantum. Quantum is coming. You gotta get ready for it. But when we think about quantum, how are we encrypting our communications going back and forth? Is our IOT or any of our connected devices able to manage quantum agile algorithms so that they can\\ncommunicate back and forth? You have that sensor, it\\'s\\nnot gonna have too much on it. So what compensating\\ncontrols do you have in place to be able to account for that? You need to think about\\nthat when you start wanting to automate and\\nconnect your devices to the infrastructure. Defense in depth, layering\\non security controls. And then what kind of visibility do you have into those devices? Everybody has some kind\\nof endpoint protection on their laptops. Everybody has something on some server that they\\'ve installed\\nin their environment. But what about all the\\nthousands of devices that don\\'t? All the unknowns that you don\\'t have. All the environments, all the labs. Everybody monitors and manages their labs really, really well, right? We have accountability for\\neverything that connects. We have patch management\\non all of those devices. We have access, we can\\nscan into the spaces. I would say that that is all challenges that we have mitigation efforts for. And so let\\'s talk about some of the things that we can do to get past some of that. And then potential compromises. How many people follow the MITRE framework or look at CVEs or listen to information or have some kind of\\nthreat intelligence fees that come into their network? But just show of hands. That\\'s good, that\\'s good. Do you automatically\\napply some of the risks that are associated to those reports to your connected devices? I mean, when you come out and say, oh, such and such, I don\\'t wanna throw any vendor on the name. Such and such vendor had a\\ncompromise on their system that\\'s running such and such a code. And you automatically\\nput that in isolation. Who does that? I mean, it\\'s available, we can do it. But how many people have a good mechanism to one, go out there and reach\\nand grab that information, two, apply it to your\\ninfrastructure in real time, and three, report on it? I mean, weak passwords. Every time we deploy an IoT device, what, the most compromised\\nor most used password is either default or password or ABC123. And guess what? It never changes. \\'Cause you think it\\'s, I don\\'t know what we\\'re thinking. We just never change it. But those are some of the things that help us understand\\nthat those compromises will spread if we don\\'t take action on it, if we don\\'t do some automation, if we don\\'t create a better playing field for AI into that space. And so get rid of the weak passwords. Create a better base of AI\\nthat can see across that so that you can secure\\nthat ecosystem from design, from the ground up, from deployment. And so when we look at this\\nand we wanna understand some of the things that we prioritize, like I was saying, build\\nsecurity from the ground up. When you deploy it, you should\\nalready have your checklist, your playlist, your policies in place that says this is how\\nwe\\'re going to do this. And if you don\\'t have it written down, \\'cause most of us, we\\'re fast thinkers. We have it in our mind\\nand we say, oh, I got it. I can do it. And then you\\'re not in that role anymore. And then the next person is saying, well, let me think of\\nwhat he was thinking about and so I can deploy. And then that person\\'s\\nnot in that role anymore. I mean, how many employees\\ndo we have that run through and are great at what they do and then they move on to a new role and then you have to start over? Starting over is extremely expensive. But if you put it in a\\nsystem that\\'s automated, if you put it in a system\\nthat is generative AI, it transcends any one individual person, transcends any one individual team, and allows you to apply\\nyour policies as necessary. And so when you\\'re doing your discovery, prioritize what you\\'re looking for. Know what you\\'re looking for. Understand when you\\'re\\ncorrelating that data and you\\'re consulting\\nwith the multiple teams, make sure that you put some prioritization around what they need\\nas well as what you need so that when you create the\\noverall database of information, it\\'s all encompassing and\\neverybody\\'s pulling stats from the same information. And if everybody\\'s pulling\\nstats from the same information, guess what? Your results are what? The same. Your stats are the same. Your prioritization becomes the same across multiple verticals. Your understanding of\\nyour risk is the same. One team should not have\\na different risk vector or risk score than another team. It should all be the same. You just need to pull out\\nwhat\\'s important to you out of that telemetry so that you can give the\\nreports for your vertical. Your security governance. Are your policies up to date? When I go and do consulting work and I talk to different companies, their policies are six years old. Their policies are four years old. When is the last time\\nyou updated your policy? Well, you know, in 2008,\\nwhen we deployed the network, the document is the same. You\\'re saying, \"Well, we\\'ve updated it.\" I said, \"Well, where\\'s the update?\" Well, that guy left. How does that help you? It doesn\\'t. I\\'m just telling you that right now. It does not. And then your custom\\nconfigurations that you\\'ve done. Every network is not the same and every network builds\\nand modifies and grows based upon the need of your growth, the need of your acquisitions. It\\'s all based upon need. Do you know what that need is? Have you written it down? And are you applying that? So when you\\'re looking at your logs and you\\'re looking at your scans and you\\'re looking at your inventory, that\\'s incomplete because you\\nhaven\\'t done any of this yet. Or you\\'ve done it and you just need a little\\nbit more maturity into it, it all needs to be the same. When you\\'re applying AI to parse through the millions and millions of logs that you get on a regular basis, and I say millions just being conservative \\'cause we get like petabytes\\nof information, right? You can\\'t sift through that. You can\\'t put enough good\\ndata into an Excel doc and make that meaningful to you. I mean, yes, we try. I mean, everybody uses\\nsome kind of Excel sheet in some fashion, but you need a mechanism\\nthat allows for you to get past the Excel doc, put it in a proper database and filter against that database and allow your AI systems to\\nhelp make decisions for you, help you get past the every day-to-day and apply your policies\\nas you have them written so you can just modify the policies and then it automatically\\nupdates your telemetry. So who benefits? Who are the benefactors from this? Well, your networking teams \\'cause they wanna know\\nwhat they need to deploy. They need to know, do I need 9Ks? Do I need something else? Do I need ILO? You know, what do I need on the back end? You know, your threat intelligence center. I mean, how many times has\\nyour SOC come back and said, okay, we found this device. It shows it to be compromised but I don\\'t have any information on it. I can\\'t click on it and get\\nthe owner of that device. This device is spewing out information out to some nation state. We see it doing it but we don\\'t know who\\ninstalled the device. We don\\'t know when it was installed. I know that\\'s unique to me but I think that a lot of people\\nrun into that same scenario and then is your procurement team aligned? You know, you\\'re deploying,\\nthey\\'re deploying, everybody\\'s deploying. They\\'re all benefactors of that. You have accountability\\nwhen your life cycle on these devices come up because they do and they need to be rotated. They\\'re all benefactors of this and then we understand our\\nsecurity operations teams and of course, is your\\nzero trust strategy mature? You\\'ve done isolation. Everybody\\'s done some level\\nof isolation management. I mean, they should have anyway. Is it good? Is it mature? Is it complete? If you deploy some of these things and you have this understanding\\nabout your environment, you can deploy a good zero trust strategy across your environment and\\nsee the benefits of that and then your assurance teams can say, \"Hey, I know what this is. \"I know what it\\'s doing. \"I know it needs to be patched.\" And then you can start sending out those nasty emails saying, \"Hey, it\\'s time to patch. \"Hey, it\\'s time to upgrade this device. \"Hey, this device is in a life. \"Hey, this device is compromised. \"We\\'re isolating off the network.\" And you understand what that really is. So let\\'s go into these different areas about discovery, about consulting across\\nour different verticals, assurance mechanism, and\\nthen how we\\'re onboarding. And then just at the end, you\\'ll be able to see\\nsome simple dashboards of what the collected\\ninformation looks like. These are not new things. There\\'s companies out there, first party, third party companies that can help you with this. But if you have the resources,\\nyou can do it internally. And I\\'ve seen it done. And if you don\\'t, then you can pay somebody\\nto do it for you. So let\\'s just take a look at\\nwhat discovery looks like. When we understand or\\nneed to ask the questions about what is important, what do we need to have in our database? What product identification is necessary? We need to talk to our different teams. We need to put our devices into\\nsome kind of classification, some kind of categorization so that we can know the difference between one type of device\\nversus another type of device so that when we\\'re making\\nrisk-based decisions, we can understand this\\nclass versus this class. Your building management\\nsystems are like this. Your IoT over here and\\nyour connected printers are like this. Or your endpoints, do\\nthey all have MDE on it? You put \\'em in different classifications so that when you run reports against how well my risk posture is, you can get a better understanding\\nof what to go tackle, how to go tackle that, and\\nwhen to go tackle that. And you have to ask the\\nquestions to yourself of this information. As I\\'m gathering this information, as I\\'m looking at this inventory, is it giving me an all-inclusive view of everything that I need to know so that the multiple teams\\ncan pull from the same data? So we talked about earlier, cross-collaboration between the teams. It has to happen. You have to have those\\nconversations with each other. And so when you make those decisions to talk with each other,\\npull in all the right data. So you know, like here\\'s an example. You got your routers, your firewalls, your threat intelligence information. Everybody needs to know the IP address of a connected device. That\\'s a given. Everybody needs to know\\nwhat the MAC address is. Everybody needs to know on and on and on. You know, here\\'s four or five right here. Some of the telemetry from\\nthe reports that I pull have 128 columns of\\ninformation that we pull and categorize in different manners. We understand what kind of vendor it is. We understand what kind of OS is on it. We understand who installed it. You know, is it connected to any of your onboarding processes? So you have a connected device, a portal. You log in and you\\nregister your information. That should push into a database. Now I\\'m connected to the infrastructure. Now I need to be accountable for that. So when that device\\ndoes something malicious or does something different, I can understand what\\'s on there. So when you pull this database, which should read in real time as much as real time as you can do so that you can apply\\nthe right policies again, write that down. Collaborate with your\\nteam so that you can know what\\'s important. We talked about the prioritization. That helps you prioritize. Bring all this information together into a single place that you can secure because we don\\'t want\\neverybody accessing it. But only you can know\\nwhat telemetry and data that you need to pull that\\'s\\nimportant for your environment. Then when we look at consulting and we look at, you know,\\nwhat does this look like from this team and from the next team? Are we aligned in our risk matrix? Have we identified the assets correctly? \\'Cause it\\'s one thing to\\nhave it in the database and you don\\'t have any information in it. \\'Cause we have databases that have gaps. I have 64 columns of information and 60 of those columns are blank. That didn\\'t help us any, right? So we have to understand and get in tools that allow us to better\\nmanage that asset inventory. When we scan for that device, when we pull the information\\nfrom the routers and switches, when we log that information, let\\'s apply identity to that as well. Because when you log in from an AP or when you VPN back into your network, I know who you are. I should know who you are. If you\\'re not collecting that information, on Connect, then you\\'re not collecting all the right information, right? If that information is not\\nshared in that database that everybody can pull from, then you\\'re not collecting\\nthe right information. When your IOT calls out and asks for information or asks something from its aggregator and you don\\'t calculate that, because let\\'s be real, sometimes our IOT systems\\ndon\\'t always beacon out. It sits there, sits there\\ndormant for a while. You still should have\\naccountability to that. It shouldn\\'t just fall off. But maybe because you categorize it right, it\\'s on a rotation where you can ping it on a monthly basis or on a weekly basis or in some other fashion so that you can have an\\nidentity associated to that and you know it\\'s still\\nlive on the network and it\\'s doing what it\\'s supposed to do. And then you can use the AI tools to help you identify what classification, if\\nit\\'s missing, looks like. So if it\\'s a similar device, deployed at a similar time, you can throw that into\\nwhatever AI tool that you have. Some of us, we can talk about\\ndifferent types of AI tools a little bit later on that you can use to do that correlation. But you need to prompt AI to give you the right information back and allow you to pull back the right classification for these devices so that when you do go out and look for risk scores against this, you have the right information classified and you can get the right risk rating and you can understand what your connected devices are doing. And then that brings you into this. You have your asset,\\nit grows your database. You have your asset information\\nin your database now. So now you\\'re filling some of those gaps. So instead of 60 blank, you have 30 blank \\'cause you now have your asset ID. You have your vendor information. You have what team it\\'s associated with. And you can start to formulate\\nwhat kind of security level, what kind of security posture that you want to have against that. The base information from your CVEs and different your risk scores that you get from various\\nthreat intelligence from a network, from an infrastructure, from a connectivity point, you can get some of that. And you can know if that\\ndevice is compromised before you start letting\\nit do anything else on the environment. You can start making decisions with that because now you have the telemetry. Now you\\'ve asked the right questions so that you can bring in\\nand do the right things against your connected devices. Your AI can help improve this, improve that classification by bringing some of that information in. It can reach out. And y\\'all been all over the expo floor. There\\'s a ton of people that can show you how that tools have been able to do this. We can talk about it later. But it can pull that CVE information and apply that in real time. And that\\'s what you wanna be able to do. You wanna be able to\\nask the right questions. A lot of times we get the\\nbest of the breed tools because it has the shiny star on it. But does it do exactly what\\nI need for my environment? Am I asking the right questions? Am I prompting my AI to give\\nme the right information? Because predicting those variations, predicting what your\\nconnected devices are doing, tracking some of that\\ncreates a lot of data. You can\\'t filter through that by just going through Excel docs or throwing it into some\\nkind of query against it. You need to put some intelligence into it. You need to pull from your\\nknown governance documents, your process documents\\nso that you can have it make good decisions for you in real time and automate some of that\\nregistration information. And just think, once you\\'re able to do it, once you\\'re able to classify it, once you\\'re able to identify this, once you\\'re able to do\\nsome of this at that level, then you can make registration automatic. I can identify the device\\nwhen it\\'s connected. If I can figure out who connected it, I can register the device as necessary. And so when we pull into the\\nassessment process of this and we have unaccounted devices, we continue to fill out that database and we understand what that\\nwhole posture looks like. And so our asset management now becomes a system of auto-identification. Our threat intelligence centers now have real-time data\\nthat they can pull from, classify and categorize in a way that we can make good reports from. And then our onboarding\\nprocess, we\\'re there. We understand. So now our zero-trust\\nstrategy can be complete. Our zero-trust strategy can now say this classification of\\ndevices needs to go over here. These devices with this high-risk score because we pulled it\\nbecause our environment, our threat intelligence\\ncenter has said these are bad. We can now deal with those. And then when our quantum capabilities start to proliferate\\nacross our environment, now we can say, hey,\\nthese are quantum-ready and these are not. We can start saying these algorithms, these devices are using\\nmechanisms that are quantum-agile and we can start pushing into future. Device management, which\\nmakes things a lot better. And then we get the gold star because now we have a one database. All our policies are automatically\\nflowing into the systems because we\\'ve asked the right questions. And then when we look at compliance, we can start pivoting against\\nthings that are important and we can start helping\\nour device management, especially for our endpoint management. We can understand and make\\nsure that those devices are just as compliant as the devices that don\\'t have some kind of MDE or some kind of endpoint\\nmanagement system on them. And our telemetry looks\\ngreat all the way across. Then we can make sure all of these items are in our reporting Wouldn\\'t it be great to say, when you provide your report, I have a risk rating\\nof my unknown devices. I don\\'t know exactly who owns it, but I know what risk score it has because I\\'ve pulled that telemetry down, because I\\'ve asked the right questions, because I\\'ve been able\\nto pull the right data, because I\\'m sharing the same\\ndatabases with everyone else. And that way one team is\\nnot more knowledgeable or has some kind of different\\ninformation than another team and you\\'re secure across\\nall your verticals. And so when we look at\\nour inventory systems, our threat intelligence\\nsystems, our security controls, we say, okay, our databases are set. Now we just continue to add\\non to what this looks like. We continue to add on to what makes this threat intelligence\\nthat we need to collect more information. So now we can look at our data and make good risk decisions because anything connected\\nin our environment, any applications that are\\nconnected in an environment should all be risk-based decisions as it\\'s connected, as it\\'s\\ninterconnected with each other. And if you\\'re not making that, then you\\'re kind of setting\\nyourself back a little bit. But putting all that information together allows you to create dashboards that give you great information. You now have the telemetry and you can just quickly\\nlook at it and say, I can show this in a report. I can show how many devices\\nare potentially compromised. I can look at this report and say, which areas I have risk the most. I can say, oh, this\\narea is being attacked, this area is being attacked. We have all of those threat maps, but do we all have it\\nwith our real-time data because we\\'re all sharing\\nthe same information. And so those are some of the things that we need to look for. So just some of the things to consider against what you wanna measure. Compliant versus non-compliant. Do we have it written down? Do we have an understanding of the devices that are in our environment\\nthat are non-compliant? I would, suffice it to say\\nthat if I ask everybody to tell me how many\\ndevices in your ecosystem are non-compliant, I probably\\nwould get a different answer from each one of you\\nabout the same information as a percentage because we, but now once we pull these things together as we\\'re asking these right questions, we can understand how to\\nbetter make that happen. Access requests. So now we can make decisions\\non what connects to what. Now we can say, hey, you\\'re logging in, your identity says you have\\naccess to this information. Now I can give you access\\nbecause I know about you. I can give you access to what\\nyou need to have access to and not just give you access to everything just because you\\'re on a\\nconnected flat network. Your hardware enforcement. Just because it doesn\\'t\\nhave an agent running on it, you can still do hardware enforcement. You can still understand\\nif this device is risky and you can understand when was\\nthe last time it was updated or what it\\'s running,\\nis that of a compromise? And that\\'s what we wanna know. And then our MITRE frameworks\\nbecome more important and more valuable to you. And then what we can see over time is we can track what that\\nlooks like over time. We can track how well\\nour environment\\'s doing. Is our processes working? That\\'s what we wanna know. We just spent a ton of\\nmoney upgrading this, upgrading that. We just spent a ton of\\nmoney buying new equipment, buying new gear. Is it working the way\\nwe need to work this? So we can use these types of dashboards to understand are we pivoting? Is our compliance? Is it all managed correctly? Is it all managed according to how we need to get information? Is it managed in a way that allows us to make good risk-based decisions? Because it\\'s asking the right questions, it\\'s implementing it in the right manner and it\\'s making sure that you can provide the telemetry back to\\nunderstand what to do next. It\\'s like I\\'ve done\\nthis, what do I do next? I\\'m tracking progress on this. Once that\\'s complete, what do I do next? We can\\'t say, okay, I\\'ve done\\nit, I\\'m done, I\\'m complete because that\\'s what gets us in trouble. That\\'s what the hackers look for. That\\'s what people are\\nalready in our environment. We need to track that, we\\nneed to understand that. We need to mitigate\\ntheir ability to be able to maneuver and pivot\\nbecause you\\'re not managing your assets well. So track that progress and\\nit\\'s just like this graph. It goes up and down. Be able to understand\\nthat and then understand what\\'s left, what do\\nwe need to pivot into, what systems do we need\\nto make better next? And so when we look at\\nour expected outcomes, things that we can take\\nback, we understand that coordination\\nbetween our partner teams and understanding\\npartner teams is not just our internal teams, it\\'s with your vendors that you\\'re working with. It\\'s with your Ciscos,\\nit\\'s with your Palo Altos, it\\'s with all of those\\ninfrastructure teams that you\\'re pulling\\nnetworking information from. Those are your partners. Those are the ones that you engage with. Those are the teams\\nthat need to be in some of those discussions so\\nthat you deploy correctly. And then that telemetry can be automated in a fashion that allows you to produce the right information. Are your programmed capabilities\\nwhere they need to be? Just because you started two years ago, have you reflected on what\\'s\\nworking positive with that versus what\\'s not? Are you able to set a goal\\nto be able to complete that and it be all-encompassing\\nor at least get you to a good starting point so\\nthat you can continue on? And then your assessment,\\nyour assessment teams and your assessment accounts. Do you have teams in place\\nthat do risk assessment on connected devices? Connectivity from A to B. Connectivity from one\\nvertical to another vertical. Connectivity between\\nyour zero-trust strategy. Your zero-trust strategy\\nis to have you going through a gate mechanism\\nwhen it\\'s connecting from one environment to\\nthe next environment. How is that working out for you? How is that process? Modify that process because\\nwe get more and more devices, more and more connected devices. So your strategy needs to\\nbe updated more and more. So expect that and understand that. And then make sure that\\nthey\\'re all risk-based. Make sure that your decisions\\nthat you come up with have some good accountability so that when you\\'re\\nmaximizing your capabilities across your ecosystem, you\\'re able to allocate resources to the right places at the right time so that you can have\\nremediation in real time because you\\'ve used your AI systems. Your connected devices have been put into an auto-identification structure because you\\'ve developed that\\nwith your cross-collaboration. And now you can start planning today and do these things as necessary. You can take some of these\\ntips and take it back and start talking with your teams, asking the right questions, and implementing the right processes. And not just talking\\nabout it, documenting it, writing it down, making sure it\\'s part of\\nyour governance strategy, and making sure that when you look at what\\'s been presented to you, if you task it out to somebody, what has been presented to you, you need. And then you can create a\\nsystem of continuous improvement which helps you all throughout. So that\\'s what we have for today. Are there any questions\\nthat we might have? All right, so let\\'s take\\nthis information back. Let\\'s have a great, great rest\\nof the conference with RSA.

I\\'m with Snowflake. I\\'m on the corporate team\\nthat runs data science and machine learning for all of Snowflake. And we work very closely with the security organization there. In my previous life, I\\'ve been\\nbuilding security products that are powered by ML and stuff like that in the CASB space, CNAPP,\\nand stuff like that. And today, we are gonna here\\ntalk about how do you secure, like, the modern data lake? These are turning out\\nto be behemoths of data. They\\'re central to the data infrastructure and data strategy for\\nany large enterprise. They\\'re starting to play a\\nmore and more critical role, especially with the advent of gen AI and LLM-based applications, which are extremely heavy on data, especially data that is\\nprobably not structured, data that probably does not\\nhave all the bells and whistles that, you know, the conventional\\ndata repositories have. Which, you know, data lakes\\nhave always been the source of. So we\\'ll kind of get\\ninto the details here. Introduce yourself. - [Gautam] Thanks everyone.\\nMy name is Gautam Kanaparthi. I\\'m a product advisor at Normalyze. I\\'ve been in the cybersecurity\\nspace for the last 15 years, so built data security products\\nacross endpoint, email, web, SaaS and so on. So, very excited to talk\\nabout this topic today. I guess, I say save the best\\ntopic for the last session. So let\\'s get going. Standard disclaimer, you\\'ve\\nprobably seen this a while back. So in terms of the agenda,\\nas Sandeep mentioned, before we dive into the actual challenges, we\\'ll do a quick overview of how the data\\ninfrastructure has evolved. Maybe look back at what data\\nsecurity used to look like, and then do a little bit\\nof an architectural review on what modern data lakes, or how we are seeing organizations\\nactually use them today. And then dive into the challenges, and a couple of case studies and some best practices as well. Actually, a bunch of you\\nmay have some handouts with some best practices,\\nso we\\'ll go over them, and ideally wrap it up with a few steps on how you can apply this\\nin the next few weeks when you go back to work. So Sandeep, over to you. - [Sandeep] Right. Thanks. So basically, we wanted to set the stage for why is this a problem? Why should you even care about it, right? Just looking at some of the data that we\\'ve been able to gather from our experience at Snowflake, and like, what Normalyze has been doing, there\\'s about 400-odd data sources that bring data into a\\nconventional enterprise data lake. And when I say data sources, these are not tables, these are not views. You\\'re talking about\\ncomplete application data that is moving in. So if you think about large organizations, and Snowflake can be an example of this, is there\\'s a lot of data\\nfrom the SaaS applications, the applications that power the business, that are being brought\\ninto these data lakes for different reasons. You\\'re talking about data enrichment, being able to tie data sources. You want the marketing campaign data to be able to go talk to the\\nsales leads data campaigns. So how do you blend them all together? Not always do you have these\\napplications talk to them. So the data lakes become central there. They are your sort of melting pot that bring the data in\\nthere, do the enrichments, push them back, reverse\\nCTL and things like that. So, 400 data sources; you\\'re\\ntalking about the complexity that comes in from the varying\\ntypes of data that come in, where there\\'s no normalization there. It is used at different\\nvelocities and cadence. There is some data that could be logged, some data that\\'s event data, and some data sets that are\\nmostly trigger-based data sets. So, how do you bring them all together? And the complexity that\\ncomes through with it. 20% of the data that sits\\nin the data lakes today, so when you look at a large enterprise, go from all of the business\\nfunctions that they have. There is sales data,\\nthere is engineering data, there is security data,\\nthere\\'s product elementary. All of those things. About 20% of the data, rough estimate, sits inside of these data lakes. And these are placed into the data lakes, either for the purpose of\\nharnessing them downstream, they are data repositories\\nfor offline jobs, for research and development\\nto happen on those data sets. There\\'s different reasons. That\\'s about 20% of utilization there. But what is anticipated, the rate at which it\\'s growing, and especially it\\'s bringing this back to the generative AI\\napplications and stuff. That number is gonna be about 90%, because a lot of that data is\\ngoing to be very easily found in the data lakes. And that\\'s going to be the first home for data of that sorts. Seven X growth in the data\\nlake utilization itself. These are numbers that we are seeing generally from the amount of workloads that are being spawned\\noff of the data lakes, the amount of downstream\\napplications and jobs that are powered for data that is sitting in the\\ndata lakes themselves, and not going into necessarily\\nthe structured data sources. And lastly, the gen AI and Bi. I come from that background. My team builds a lot\\nof these applications, and we are starting to see that shift, where majority of the\\ndata that is powering these ML and AI applications, especially in the generative AI side, are coming from the data lakes. Again, that\\'s because of\\nhow conventionally the data that the gen AI applications\\nare helping produce value out of we\\'re always sitting in these kind of data lakes. If you look at, in general,\\nthe data infrastructure itself, there was obviously like, the early days of like on-prem legacy services. You\\'re talking about, you\\nknow, data stores, racks even, that housed a lot of this data. The next phase, the next wave of this was the proliferation of the\\nSaaS applications, right? 2005-2015 was the growth\\nof the SaaS world. There\\'s literally everything that we did on the local devices now\\nmoved onto to the SaaS world. The cloud was the biggest thing there. So, a lot of the data\\nproliferation happened to those SaaS applications. Then came the wave of the\\npublic infrastructure, the public clouds with the\\nAWSs, Azure and the GCPs of the world. All of the data that was\\ngetting stored there, the data that was being\\ngenerated in these systems and things like that. And lastly, the phase that we are in, which is of hyperscale for data itself, and how does it get stored? How does it get evaluated and stuff? Platforms like Snowflake,\\nDatabricks, Redshift, BigQuery. These are becoming the\\ncentral part of the strategy for almost all large enterprises. You\\'d hardly find an enterprise that probably doesn\\'t have one of those hyperscale data\\nplatforms in their ecosystem. - [Gautam] I think one of the\\nthings just worth calling out is these represent what\\ndifferent kinds of tools existed, but they also kinda represent how the value and volume of\\ndata has shifted over the years. If you were to go back maybe 15 years, you would say, \"Most of my\\ndata is actually on-prem.\" To the point that Sandeep made earlier, now most of the data is actually\\nmoving into your data lake. So the velocity of data is\\nactually higher in data lakes. And the business value of the data today is more in data lake than the data that\\'s\\nactually sitting on premises in some other database, or some SharePoint or something like that. - [Sandeep] All right. Yeah. Good. - [Gautam] I think in parallel to that, we also wanted to quickly look back how data security solutions\\nhave evolved over time, right? In a world where most\\nof the data was on-prem, you could have done maybe an endpoint DLP, maybe a DLP for your network\\ndrive, or something like that. But as data moved into SaaS applications, let\\'s say with the proliferation\\nof Office 365, Box, Dropbox, Salesforce, and so\\non, then came the CASB tools, the cloud access security\\nbrokers of the world. And their primary intent was to help you discover\\nSaaS applications, and the kind of data that\\'s actually used in those SaaS applications, right? But that was not the end\\nof the data platforms. Today we are seeing data\\nplatforms in the cloud, public cloud like AWS, GCP, and\\nthe data lakes of the world. So what we are seeing\\nreally is a preference towards one platform that\\ndoes all your data security and data security needs. What we are seeing generally\\nacross the board is, \"Hey, do I really need to\\nadd another data DLP solution for the silo? Do I really need to manage\\na different DLP solution, one for the endpoint, one for email, one for my network drive,\\none for SaaS application, one for IAS, another one for data lake?\" So that\\'s really where we\\nare seeing the shift to, \"I need one platform that addresses all my data\\nsecurity program needs. It doesn\\'t matter where my data resides, it may move from one platform to another, but my data security should\\nreally remain constant.\" And that\\'s where we are\\nseeing the emergence of DSPM platforms. - [Sandeep] For those few,\\njust to kind of bring everybody to the same page, the way\\nthe conventional data lakes that you think about today are; there is a central data store, right? This is where you have all\\nof your data coming in. This is structured data. This can be, you know, unstructured data. This could be semi-structured data. This could be, you know,\\nlive feeds coming in, but anything that you\\nwant to have in there. And then, there is a compute\\nlayer that sits on top of it. So the whole idea is you\\ndon\\'t have to move the data in a traditional sense, move it into a compute cluster\\nand run your applications and run your transformations in there. You\\'re able to do that, right\\nin the infrastructure itself. And then, on the very top of that, you have all sorts of\\napplications built on it. Think about optimization, applications, transactions, the\\naspects that are required for somebody to have the\\nsecurity and governance around this, the visibility,\\nthe data operations, data quality, all of those things are sort of value-added\\nlayer on the top of that. So, what you have is a single place all the way from getting the\\ndata and storing the data to getting, you know,\\ncompute cycles out of that and producing value. All of those things sit\\nin one place, right? That\\'s the very promise of this. And which, going back to Gautam\\'s point, is also why DSPM as our data\\nsecurity posture management is becoming more and more central. Because, as data is all\\nkind of coming together into one place, both\\nfrom a value standpoint and also from a consolidation standpoint, you want all your policies\\nto be sitting in one place. You want the posture to\\nbe measured as a unison, rather than, you know,\\ntrying to piece together a collage of different policies\\nand different postures. So, if you look at the different things that, you know, large enterprises, and I\\'m focusing on large enterprises, but this will apply to, you\\nknow, any sort of data strategy. The reason data lakes are\\nbecoming more and more prominent are like, some of these applications that are sitting out there, right? It\\'s a centralized data repository. Like I said, you want initiatives that cut across different applications. You want to run programs\\nthat need to leverage data from different domains of the business. What you call the data\\nlake serves that purpose. Data exploration and research. It\\'s really important. That\\'s why we put it twice on that slide. That is another piece\\nwhere people are trying to still understand what is that data. If you think about the general statistics, 80% of enterprise data\\nis unstructured data that is not being mined today. It is being used for content generation. It is being used for different purposes, but it\\'s not a part of the core insights that drive the organization, right? And that is where the data lake will start to kind of help produce, get more value and things like that. Machine learning applications\\nactually feed off of that. A lot of the machine learning applications that you\\'ve seen in the enterprise world will require large amounts of data. It is usually better served\\nif it is sitting in one place. You need longer training\\nwindows, historic data, six months, nine months, 18 months. the longer the time window of the data, the larger the amount of data, the better the models perform, right? So, it kind of helps there. Building platform native\\ndata applications. Even at Snowflake, we build a\\nlarge number of applications that are native to the platform itself. These are data applications. These are not like the custom applications that traditional world. These are applications that are helping drive business decisions. These are applications that help you protect the organization. You know, kind of look at the trends in how the business is performing. All sorts of things that are being powered by native applications\\nthat are sitting there, and business and\\nintelligence and analytics. This has been the traditional path, like reporting how the health\\nof the business metrics, you know, customer sentiment, all sorts of analytics\\nthat needs to run this data can now be sitting in\\nhere without constraints or restrictions of how\\nyou run these reports, and stuff like that. And typically, you want\\nto run these reports off of large dataset. So that\\'s where it kind of helps. So, if you look at the\\nnative security controls that most of these platforms come with, most of the data lakes\\nare automatically enabled. I will not go through the entire list, but single sign on,\\nmultifactor authentication, these are standard things, like, how do you control\\nthe authentication and authorization on the\\ndata access control policies? How do you set up your RBAC? How do you enable data sets to be shared with some sense of governance? That is partial access, right? Like, row and column level access. Like, how do I make\\nsure that a certain team only has access to the obfuscated data, which is not PIA? How do I make sure that a\\ncertain cut of the data, horizontal slice of the data is available to a certain function, not to others? So all of those things\\nare typically enabled as native controls on these\\ndata platforms themselves. Things like data masking, bring your own keys, key management. All of these are sort of\\nthe bare minimum constructs that most of these data lakes\\ncome out of the box with. So if you look at the very bare bottom, like the native controls\\nfocus on the infrastructure, it kind of ensure that\\nthey piece together, or they give you the building blocks for you to piece together the enterprise security program itself. Like, what are the different\\nthings that you want enabled? What are the different things that you want to have\\nvisibility around there, all can be enabled through\\nthese sort of native controls. - [Gautam] Yeah, I think\\nthat\\'s an important distinction to make, is a lot of times we\\nhear security practitioners and people that work on data lake as well try to figure out, \"Yeah, I\\nhave all these security controls from this native platform. Why do I still need something else?\" And that\\'s kind of the point\\nSandeep was trying to make, is infrastructure security\\nand access securities where those native\\ncontrols tend to focus on. But you as a security team\\nstill need to figure out, \"How do these controls align\\nwith what I want to achieve as part of my data security program? Does that align with all\\nthe data security controls that I have in other data\\nstorage infrastructure as well?\" So, there\\'s still work that the security team is responsible for at the end of the day. So, you cannot just rely\\non what is available out of the box. You need to do a little bit\\nmore work beyond that as well, because not every use case that you have across your corporate policy is addressed by the native controls. - [Sandeep] So, it\\'s a good segue for what are the challenges that exist, despite of the native\\ncontrols that come along with some of these platforms, right? So, volume and velocity of the\\ndata that\\'s getting ingested. If you think about a large\\nenterprise, like I said, there\\'s 400 to 700\\ndifferent SaaS applications each of these enterprises are using. And there is a different rate at which the data is being produced in these different applications. You have sales applications\\nthat are probably updated by the sales staff, the field folks, probably once a day, once\\na week kind of thing. You have applications that\\nare security applications that are gathering logs from the devices that are running within your enterprise. Those are generating multiple\\nlogs every second, right? You have applications that\\nare custom applications internally being run. You have applications that\\nyour customers are using. So the the veracity, the volume\\nand the velocity of the data that is coming into these\\ndata lakes is phenomenal. And what that basically does is how do you keep up with that data? Now if you think about\\nit, every new application that\\'s rolled out, or if\\nyou have a product feature, an enterprise product feature, every new rollout of the feature, or even a small\\nmodification of that feature can produce a different set\\nof product telemetry for you. And that telemetry could\\nbe of different sorts. They could be error\\nlogs that are coming in that may have PIA data in that. So, they could be logs that\\nare, you know, high volume logs that have just changed overnight. How do you keep up with all of those? That\\'s one big challenge. The second one is the\\ncomplex web of users. Like, if I can just sort of project this off of our experience at Snowflake, you have data scientists who\\nneed access to this data, because they\\'re building time\\nseries and forecasting models. You have security engineers\\nwho need access to this data because they\\'re trying to\\ndo like, threat detection. They\\'re trying to do incident response. You have marketing folks\\nwho want to drive access to this data to be able to\\ngo target certain customers with new features that have come out. There is product managers\\nwho want access to this data because they want to be able to see how a certain feature is being adopted. When you look at all of\\nthese different use cases, it is different personas, it is different sort of\\napplications of the data itself. And what that means is you need to enable that\\naccess in a different way. The product managers, because\\nit\\'s product elementary, the data has to be sort\\nof rinsed a certain way, and cleansed before it can\\nactually be handed off. If it\\'s a security logs, it is a different set of\\ngranularity of the data that you want to be able to produce. So the very nature of these\\nusers makes it really difficult for managing this data without like, a DSPM kind of a solution in place, right? But third party access is\\none something I missed. There are applications, and I\\'m sure most of the\\nenterprises have this, which are external third party vendors who are hooking into your data lakes to provide value added services. This could be sensitive data discovery, this could be enrichment, this\\ncould be data clean rooms, could be a bunch of different reasons. And all of that data, how\\ndo you manage that access? And it\\'s almost like you\\nhave a dedicated service that is necessary. A set of, you know, admins\\nand administrative oversight that you have to invest in to be able to make the\\ndata useful and functional to all of these use cases. Data classification,\\nthat\\'s like with GDPR, with all of the regulatory frameworks that are coming around, that have mandates on how\\ncertain data has to be handled, how certain data has to be\\nstored, who gets access to it, what is the, you know, audit controls and compliance controls\\nthat need to be in place. Being able to sort of\\norchestrate all of that. The core tenet, at least\\nsomething that we\\'ve identified at Snowflake was our ability\\nto classify the data. How reliably can we actually identify which data sits where,\\nhow sensitive is it, how do we classify it, how does it reflect back\\non the internal enterprise data classification policies? And stuff like that. So, that is difficult. And being able to do this\\nat fast moving data sets, that makes it even more difficult. And the last one is compliance across that vast infrastructure, right? If you think about some of these platforms you\\'re talking about, just\\nto give a Snowflake example, you\\'re talking about\\nmore than 100,000 tables that need to be monitored. You\\'re talking about hundreds of schemas that are spun up on a daily basis. Some persist for a long time, some don\\'t. There are views that are created\\nwhere data is being shared between two functional owners, like marketing trying to share data with the salespeople and\\nstuff like that, right? How do you kind of make sure\\nthat the compliance framework or the visibility for how\\nthat data is being used and handled is consistent\\nacross the place? And you\\'re actually\\nable to report on that, because almost all these cases, you have some sort of a regulatory body. Or what do you call external auditors, where you want to be able to show that these are all the\\ncontrols that we have in place, and how they\\'re being leveraged? Next one. So, this is kind of going back, and specifically into the\\norganizational structure itself. At Snowflake, what we have done is it\\'s a centralized data\\nengineering team that we have. This group is responsible\\nfor bringing data from all of these sources that\\nwe need to ingest data from. But what happens is the\\nownership of the data itself resides with the functional owners. So in our case, the functional owners are sales as a functional owner. Marketing is one, finance is one. So all of these business\\nunits that own the data with a specific business outcome in mind are the ones who own these\\nfunctional databases. Now, something that\\nI\\'ve already mentioned: these are traditionally data silos, but for the data lake to be functional, and for the broader organization\\nto get benefit from it, you wanna be able to share the\\ndata across these functions. And that\\'s where the\\norganizational structure. and how do you place that data\\nin a way that can be shared and be benefited while\\nmaintaining the sanctity and the security required\\naround that data, it becomes important. Ownership and accountability of the data. Despite the ownership\\nfrom a domain standpoint, what we\\'ve realized, and also talking to a\\nlot of large enterprises, one of the challenges is to begin with the data is owned by\\na functional individual or a functional team. Let\\'s talk about sales. Now, with the growing number\\nof sales applications, with the growing number\\nof application owners, what it means is all of this data, the individual functional\\nowner of that data may not have full control\\nand full visibility, and even agency on that data itself. So, it starts to become\\na fragmented sense, where some parts of the data\\nis owned by individuals. Some parts of the data\\nis owned by individuals who do not fully understand that data. And that introduces challenges, in terms of how you manage this data, and what you do with it. And lastly, the operational overhead, and how do you optimize\\nall of this, right? Like if you think about, and I\\'ll talk about this\\nin the next slide as well, is the separation of duties. There are functional DB owners who are technically the\\ncustodians of the data, but then they\\'re also people who are tasked with leveraging\\nthe benefits out of the data to be able to derive\\noutcomes of that data. So if you think about\\nmarketing individuals, marketing data sets, while the responsibility\\nfrom a DSPM standpoint is for the custodian to make\\nsure that all the PII data or identifiable marketing\\ncampaigns are actually redacted, so that way other teams don\\'t have it. But if you kind of contrast\\nthat with the efficacy of a marketing campaign, it\\'s\\nimportant that you have this, so that way you can actually\\nrun, what do you call, targeted ad campaigns\\nif you have to, right? So, how do you make sure\\nthat the owners of the data and the administration of the data, there is good sense of\\nseparation of duties in that? Like, that\\'s a challenge in that. That also kind of extends into who\\'s managing the access controls. There is just in time access controls, there is, what do you call, access that is given\\npermanently to service accounts. There is access that is\\ngiven to third party vendors who are connecting into this\\ndata for enrichment and stuff. How do you kind of make\\nsure across the time slice that all of these controls,\\nthe user access policies, they all remain cogent and current? From just a case study for\\nlike, what we\\'ve experience. If you look at this is partially inspired. It\\'s not one enterprise\\nacross a group of enterprises that I\\'ve interacted with. There is no source of truth\\nfor what data is being stored. When you think about the engineering teams or the data engineering teams that are responsible for bringing the data into your data lake, they may or may not be\\nexperts in the system itself, the upstream system. So, they\\'re bringing data blindly. There\\'s an API that the, what\\ndo you call, app enables. And you just pulling the data in, they\\'re making sure that\\nas much data as possible can land the data. The data is fresh, the data is current and all of those things, but they don\\'t really understand what is that data actually\\nholding onto, right? Similarly, the second aspect of this is upstream applications and new features, new capabilities, whatever it is, is increasing the amount\\nof data that\\'s produced. So, if you think about an application like Microsoft Office 365, if there is three parts of that portfolio that the organization uses, now you add a fourth one to it that introduces a new data set, and the application owners\\nmay or may not be fully aware of what data it\\'s pulling in, and how does one part of the data relate to the other part of the data, right? So, there\\'s a lot of nuances that are sort of baked into\\nhow that data is brought in, which are not clear to everybody who\\'s operating on that data. Overhead of security oversight. It bleeds in from that first topic itself, which is, if you don\\'t know what data sits in your data lakes, or\\nif you\\'re not fully aware of the classification on the data or the context of the data, how do you enable access\\ncontrol on top of it, right? You may not always have the\\nvisibility that you need. And with growing organizations, Snowflake is a great example for this, is the way we have ramped\\nup as an organization, the companies grow. Therefore, the number of employees grow. And what we\\'ve realized\\nis the number of roles that are created to access\\nthese kind of things grow at a rate that\\'s exponential to the growth of the\\nusers themselves, right? So, what you end up having\\nis the initial euphoria of enabling every employee\\nin your organization to have access to, you know,\\nthe treasure of this data very quickly turns into a problem of managing access to all of this data, making sure that the right\\nset of people have access. It is revoked when that use\\ncases have, you know, diminished and stuff like that. That\\'s a really big challenge. The user landscape evolves in general. You have, for example, a team moves over from being a growth analytics team to a growth marketing team, right? So all of a sudden,\\ntheir need of the data, their view of the data and\\ntheir utility of the data has completely changed. Now, who is responsible? If you think about it, it\\'s dynamic, and some of these things\\nhappen over a matter of months, not even like years or quarters. So when that happens,\\nwhat we\\'ve experienced is the data administrators\\nend up always on a back foot. They\\'re reacting to these kind of changes, and they\\'re trying to make sure that while the organizational\\ndynamics have moved along, they\\'re still trying to catch up, making sure that the\\nadministrative posture of the data itself is catching up to that. Data governance and monitoring in general. This is for the sake of compliance. This is for the sake of certifications. This is assurance that enterprises have to give to their own customers. All of these things, there\\nare hundreds of controls that are in place. If you think about Snowflake\\nand some of the things that we\\'ve done, security of the data, security of the customer\\ndata especially is paramount. And when you\\'re trying to kind of assure that what you end up having is also trying to comply with\\na bunch of certifications. Literally every country and\\nevery region has a certification and a regulatory requirement now, right? So, being able to kind\\nof cope with all of this, what that essentially ends up being is you have hundreds and\\nhundreds of controls, and you need to be able\\nto manage and monitor all of those controls. You need to make sure that those controls are current to the data and\\nthe posture that you have. All of those are pretty much bleeding in from the fact that the data\\nlakes are going hyperscale. There is lot more orders\\nof magnitude of data that is landing into these data\\nlakes, and stuff like that. Now, in terms of the desired solution, like, what is it that would help us? If I am one of those\\nenterprise data owners, and what are the things that I would need to kind of create a cohesive platform that we kind of want to go off of? Sensitive data discovery, like I said, that is the most important. Like, for the most part\\nwhat we\\'ve realized is even the data that has\\nbeen classified a week ago can change. Meaning that this, especially\\nwith unstructured data or data that brings in, what do you call, user generated content\\nand stuff like that, it becomes really difficult\\nfor you to keep track of that. So it is really important that\\ndata classification is done on an ongoing basis as fast\\nand as frequently as possible, to be able to make sure\\nthat there is a good sense of what sensitive data sets were. Data type discovery. Baked into sensitive data discovery itself is what are the types of data? Because your downstream processes\\nfor controlling the access to the data, to making sure\\nthe data is made available a certain way to a certain group of users. This could be masking. This could be, like I\\nsaid, role level controls and all of that. All of that requires the knowledge of what are the data types, right? If I have to obfuscate data, if you have to do, for example,\\nanonymization of the data, execute a differential privacy, it\\'s really important for us\\nto know what data sits there, not just the sensitivity of the data. So, that\\'s important there. Machine learning capabilities. As fond of machine learning as I am, it brings in a lot of problems with that, because machine learning\\nis usually focused on getting the insights out. It does not have a sense\\nof how to handle data. It does not have a sense\\nof maintaining the privacy of the data, making\\nsure that the constructs of the data are not abused, to an outcome that the\\nmachine learning algorithm or model is driving, right? Like, how do you kind of\\nget a sense of all of that? Continuous discovery. Like I said, the need to keep\\nup with the evolving nature of the data. There\\'s a new data set that\\nlanded. What type of data is it? Who owns that data? What classification of the data is it? What is the retention of that? All of those things are\\nchanging by the source, are changing by the instance of the data that\\'s getting stored. Enabling data protection. Like I said, data\\nclassification is important, but once you\\'ve identified\\nthat this is sensitive data, then you can either\\nleverage the native controls that the platform gives you\\nfor encryption, data masking. You know, what do you call\\nother data protection strategies that are in place. But it\\'s important to\\nhave something like that. And there are a lot of\\nthe DSPM applications that are out there, DSPM vendors that are out there. They kind of let you borrow a hand from the native capabilities\\nof the product itself. So, you have a unified policy that is defined for data protection, but that can be enabled\\nthrough the native controls off the platform, or\\nwherever the data is stored. Seamless access governance. Again, this also ties\\nback to the being able to compliance with the data enable scale, like efficient data discovery\\nand stuff like that. These are all aspects where the traditional\\nway of enabling access will not sort of conform to what the needs of the\\nenterprise today are. Essentially, where we end up being is you want to be able\\nto discover the data as fast as possible. There\\'s more data coming in. There\\'s a lot more consumers of the data. You want to be able to\\nhelp them get benefit from that data as fast as possible, and that\\'s where the data\\ndiscovery becomes important, and access governance tends\\nto be a blocker in that. So, that\\'s what you wanna work against. - [Gautam] And just to add a quick point, I think for those that are\\nfamiliar with the old school DLP and have run DLP programs like years ago, some of the themes may seem similar, but there\\'s some nuances\\nthat are different around data lakes, right? You see call outs for scalability, definitely the scale of\\nwhat the data in data lakes is much, much larger. So, it\\'s not like taking\\nan old school DLP engine and putting it on top of a data lake. That wouldn\\'t really work. The other piece here that is unique is the access governance, right? How complex the access governance is. In the old world, you probably could deploy\\nan agent on the endpoint, and it\\'s basically blocking what it sees. But here in the data lake, fundamentally you\\'re trying\\nto discover everything so you know what kind of\\nsensitivity data is where. Again, it\\'s a matter of scale, but it\\'s also some fundamental\\ndifferences in approach to, say, \"Let me discover\\neverything first, let me figure out who\\nactually has access to what,\" and then start enforcing\\nsome data controls, so that while the high level\\ntopics may sound similar, there are significant differences, which is why the old school DLP solutions wouldn\\'t really work in\\nthis particular case. - [Sandeep] Right. And lastly, when you\\'re\\nevaluating a solution for this place, one of the biggest challenges\\nis how do you classify data that you already don\\'t\\nknow the labels for, right? So that\\'s something that, for example, when we were doing, \"How do you identify a\\ngolden truth data set?\" You need to know if the\\nsensitivity classification or the tags that are being produced, you have a ground truth\\nto kind of go off of, having a clearly documented\\nevaluation criteria for like, how do you think about your DSPM not as an application or as a problem, but as a strategy? What do you call data security\\nmean to your organization, and how do you want to\\nsort of characterize the quality or the maturity\\nof where it stands, right? So, being able to have a\\nclearly articulated way of defining it that is sort of agreed upon across the organization is\\nan important starting point. And lastly again, it comes down\\nto build versus buy, right? There are platforms. Like we said, the data platforms that come with native controls that\\ncan be leveraged for this. So, depending on what your use cases are, depending on what is the\\nflexibility that you have in being able to, you know,\\nextend these capabilities to suit your needs, it\\'s a discussion\\nbetween build versus buy. - [Gautam] Yeah, I\\'ll\\ntalk about case study two. Case study one, I think Sandeep has\\nhands-on experience there. Case study two is another customer that I work pretty closely with. A lot of the themes are similar. The core need starts from\\njust the volume of data, where earlier we would\\nprobably talking in gigabytes. Now, people are just\\ntalking in petabytes, right? It\\'s not even terabytes anymore. There\\'s tons and tons of data. So in this particular case,\\nover five petabytes of data, and they had absolutely no visibility. So all of that was basically a black box. They did not know what kind\\nof data was being put in into that big repository, right? Again, the theme of user\\npermissions is consistent across customers that\\nare using data lakes. The volume of users and\\nthe complexity of user to specific data store permission, and the levels of permissions, is what makes it very for\\nsecurity team to monitor. It\\'s not just enabling access. It\\'s to say, \"Okay, this person, can they actually go edit PII? Can they read PII? Can they download it? Can they make changes to that PII?\" They need to understand it at that level. And the automatic role\\ngrants doesn\\'t really help. So, if a new employee joins, and automatically the team they\\'re part of gets grants to X number of roles, now they have access to\\na wide variety of data that they don\\'t necessarily need. And lastly, the federated data ownership. So, data is kind of interwoven,\\nit\\'s not just static. You may have access to\\na view, for example, that is consolidating data\\nfrom 10 different tables, and they may not be\\nsensitive in isolation, but when you put them all together, they actually may end up\\nbeing super sensitive, that you should not even have access to. How do you even get visibility to that? So in this particular customer\\'s case, they didn\\'t even understand that I actually have a scenario like this where sensitive data is\\ninadvertently being exposed, right? So even for them, as we talk to them and understand their need better, the desired solution was very similar. Start with classification. Start with helping me understand,\\n\"What do I actually have? Do I really have a lot of PII? Is it PCI? Do I have data in regions where I should really be worried about? Am I under purview of GDPR, and how much of my data\\nis actually there?\" And do that on a continuous basis. It cannot be a onetime exercise, right? Onetime exercise is good\\nfor initial visibility for you to understand\\nwhat is the scope of work, but you have to keep doing\\nit on an ongoing basis. Access governance; it\\'s\\nvery similar themes to Sandeep\\'s use case there, as well. I think scale stands out all the time. It\\'s a matter of, even if\\nyou have a scanning engine, can it actually scale\\nto petabytes of data? How long does it take? You can\\'t afford to run\\nscans for months on end and incur those costs to understand it. So, being able to run that\\nvery quickly and efficiently from a cost perspective\\nas well is a big criteria. So at the end of the implementation, yeah, they went with\\nDSPM platform as well. When they did the initial audit, what they found was they\\nactually had three X more data than they expected. They had databases that\\nthey didn\\'t even know they actually had, and they realized a vast\\nmajority of the users actually have access to sensitive data. In their case, it was PII, right? And these were fundamentally things that the security team\\nwas not even in the loop, and they were not even aware that this was actually\\nhappening in their environment. And they ended up prioritizing PII. For them that was the\\nmost valuable set of data. For you, it may be something else, but you ought to start\\nwith an initial audit and understanding what you actually have. And they use this in size to identify what are the unused access privileges. So, they really wanted to\\nenforce least privilege across the board. So they went about understanding, \"I have all these privileges, but who is actually using them?\" And if they\\'re using them,\\nhow recently have they used? How often they have they used? So they can rightsize the permission set, but the fundamental visibility helped them make those\\ndecisions and put them in place. And lastly, they chose to\\nincorporate auto-remediation. Meaning if they already\\nknew something was an issue and there was a documented process on what exactly to do in\\nthis particular scenario, they could put the remediation\\nin place to say, for example, \"If I see a new user coming\\nin that is part of X group and they have access to PII, and I would want them\\nto have access to PII, revoke that access,\" for example. So the key thing, as you\\'ve seen and we\\'ve talked about earlier, all of these are not\\njust challenges in silos with data lakes, right? There are definitely nuances, but if you look at it from an overall data\\nsecurity program perspective, all of these are similar themes, similar challenges that you would run and encounter in other places, but where you store data. Definitely the data lakes\\ntake it to another level in terms of scale. So, as you think about what\\nyou do for data security for your data lakes, make\\nsure it is in alignment with what you do for data\\nsecurity across the board. You cannot have, again,\\na data security program for each surface where\\nyou\\'re storing data. It has to align with the\\noverall data security program. Whether it is about classification, do you have a standard\\nclassification nomenclature? Do you have standardized workflows? If you find sensitive data, are you following the same\\nprocesses across the board? And how are you actually monitoring and enforcing compliance? All of those should be pretty\\nsimilar across the board, and not just unique to the data lake. So Sandeep, I\\'ll kind of build this out, and then you can talk through this. - [Sandeep] In terms of\\nthe best practices, right? And these are lessons\\nfrom what we have learned, these are things that we\\'ve seen across large organizations and stuff. I\\'ll read the first one out. I understand clearly enumerate your sensitive data\\nclassification requirements, to the earlier point that we said is across the organization, given the nature of your business, given the nature of the data that is brought into the data lake, there are variations in how you define a sensitive data policies. So, being able to have a consistent policy that can be applied in\\na simplistic fashion across the organization\\nis really important. Again, like, find all PII. That seems to be the flavor\\nof sensitive data discovery, but there\\'s a lot more\\nto be able to understand like, which data types\\nhave what implications, and how they can be used. Ensure all compliance\\nrequirements are identified. Again, this has again got to do with the business and the markets that the enterprise operates in. So, if you have regulatory requirements that are specific to your industry, or are regulatory requirements that are specific to the\\ngeography that you operate in, being able to have a good sense\\nof a running up to date list of all the compliance\\ncontrols that are necessary, that\\'s important. And finally, confirm the capabilities that the platform not\\nnatively comes with, right? They tend to be easy to use,\\nthey tend to be efficient, but they also tend to\\nbe limited in the scope. So, it\\'s out of prudence\\nthat you have to kind of go get a good sense of\\nwhat are the limitations of the basic capabilities that these platforms enable natively? - [Gautam] And just a quick call out to one of the earlier points from Sandeep: I think having a point of view on false positive versus false negative is definitely important. We\\'ve seen organizations where\\nfalse positive is really bad, but we\\'ve also seen organizations where, \"Hey, I don\\'t want to\\nabsolutely miss anything. When I tell an auditor\\nthat I don\\'t have PII in a certain data store, I\\nwant to be 100% confident there\\'s absolutely no PII.\" So in that case, you don\\'t\\nwant false negatives, right? So it may differ based\\non the organization, based on the industry you are in. So that\\'s something to think about, especially as you are trying to put in some kind of data\\nclassification engine in there so you know what to optimize for. - [Sandeep] Where a false\\npositive will translate into, you know, some sort of friction in getting an insight\\nor getting an app out. A false negative is\\nbasically a data leak, right? So the implications are vastly different. - [Gautam] Yeah, I think\\nwe talked through that. - [Sandeep] Yeah. In terms of kind of keeping\\nup with the same thing is monitoring of access privileges, right? Like, to what Gautam said,\\na lot of the organizations, just by the virtue of\\nhow the data has evolved, users have evolved and their\\nuser requirements have evolved. There\\'s some general stats out there that\\'ll tell you that, but 90% of the access that\\'s been granted to an enterprise user is not leveraged on a\\nday-to-day basis, right? So, this is essentially\\ndata that can be exposed. This is data that can\\nfall into the wrong hands or you know, is out there. So there is an absolute necessity\\nthat there is some system that\\'s in place that evaluates\\nevery individual\\'s access, especially to the sensitive data, and make sure that it is,\\nyou know, cut to size. There\\'s this trim out\\nas much fat as possible. Enforcing least privilege. By default, a lot of organizations\\nunder, what do you call, aegis of making data available\\nand being data driven, take on the path of least resistance and, \"We will give everybody\\naccess to all sorts of data, and then we will pull\\nback on a need basis.\" It should actually be turned. That should be turned on and said, \"What you want to do is least privilege.\" You don\\'t want to sort of\\nproliferate access to the data, especially if it\\'s sensitive data, especially if you don\\'t know\\nyour chickens or your data in this case. Ongoing monitoring. Again, for all aspects\\nof what data comes in, like I said, the velocity\\nand the veracity of the data that lands into these\\ndata lakes is insane. So how do you make sure that, you know, there is some sense of a\\npulse of all the new data, the new tables that are getting created, the new data shares\\nthat are being enabled, even the roles that inherit\\nsensitive data roles and stuff like that? How do you keep a check on all of these escalation of privileges? These are all aspects that are granular, but they need to be looked\\nat on a regular basis to make sure that none of them\\nbecomes a big, gaping hole. Lastly, what we\\'ve been calling out, the data security program, right? So this is independent of the platform. This is independent of how you\\nenforce data classification or how do you sort of\\napply data classification, use it downstream and stuff. But having a cohesive\\ndata security program, having all the stakeholders\\nin the same room and kind of align on what that is, and how do you want to go about it? And especially being practical\\nabout what you can achieve. Like, this data security program cannot be overhauled overnight, right? So, how do you kind of pave the way? And you set your milestones so that you get to that final ideal state in a fashion that does\\nnot impact productivity of the organization, does\\nnot impact the top line or the bottom line for your business, but kind of ensures that you do this while making sure you don\\'t rock the boat. Clarifying ownership and responsibilities. It\\'s a part of that security data program. For example, at Snowflake we have a very clearly defined race\\nagainst all of our data stores. Who owns them? Who acts on\\nthem? Who consults on them? Who is responsible for\\nthe individual pieces? Even in the responsibility matrix. It is what aspects of data\\nsecurity does one group own, versus what aspects of the responsibility does the other group own, right? So, all of those things, being\\nable to clearly lay that out and have everybody kind of attest to that, the accountability and the\\ntransparency in the process makes it even more easy to kind of enforce and implement all of these. And lastly, being able to not\\njust monitor but act on it. Have provisions, have processes in place, so that you\\'re not reacting\\nto, you know, incidents, you\\'re not reacting to data\\nleaks, and stuff like that, or new findings, but you kind of have a\\nprocess of responding to them. - [Gautam] Great. So I know there\\'s a lot of\\njargon generally thrown around in the security industry, but for data lakes, I think\\nfollowing these best practices should serve you well. So, if you kind of go back to work and think about what to\\ndo for data security, this is our recommendation, right? So in the next week, you\\ncould start with an audit of your data lake. Like we talked about in\\nthe case studies earlier, start always with an audit. So understand what you\\nactually have first, before you dive into further details. And then you can figure out, \"Okay, where to prioritize? Which data store to prioritize? Which parts of the data\\nlake do we even start with?\" You don\\'t have to boil the ocean and start with the entire\\nrepository of the data lake at the same time. So in the first three months, you could then do a\\ncomprehensive discovery. Maybe you find out that\\nyou have a lot of PII. Dive into PII, dive into, \"What types of PII do I have? Who actually has access to that? How is it actually coming in?\" So, you have a full catalog of inventory, and you also understand what is the rate at which that\\'s changing. Are you seeing a lot of new data stores being created with PII? So, that should take you\\nthe first three months to kind of get a full understanding of how your data is evolving,\\nwhere it is being created, and what kind of data\\nand access and so on. And then you can do a full inventory and understand who are the\\nusers, what are the privileges? Are they changing rapidly?\\nAre they actually being used? And then start putting some controls around enforcing the\\nprinciple of least privilege. And post that, you could do other things around operationalizing your\\ndata security to the fullest. So, you could drive\\noperational projects to say, \"I want to now discover sensitive data everywhere in my data lake. I wanna see where else it\\'s coming from. Let me also go incorporate\\na data security program over there.\" Actually act on it to proactively monitor, rather than trying to\\nreactively understand what has happened. Anything new that is created\\nshould automatically be fed in. You are ideally integrating them into your remediation process. People are getting notified\\nwhen something is sensitive that is found, and if\\nsome violation happens with the user privileges, that should automatically be triaged and created a ticket\\nfor the team and so on. But that should probably\\nbe like six months or so. But you could start with a quick audit, so you know how severe the problem is, or how much time you need to\\nspend, and then go from there. Sandeep, in terms in your experience, does this align with how\\nyou approach as well? - [Sandeep] Yeah, just\\nbased on our experience working with a lot of customers\\nand large enterprises, what we\\'ve seen is the first two drive all the program forward. The minute you\\'ve identified\\nwhat all data you have, and the amount of sensitive\\ndata that\\'s out there, and how many people have access to it, that is a driving force in itself. Usually the program gets\\ninto an autopilot mode that point forward. So, the things that you\\ndo in the first week and the first three months, depending on the level of maturity of your data security program, it can be daunting, and\\nit can be frightening, to be completely honest, but that will drive the program forward, because everybody wants\\nto be sure about the data, so it\\'ll go on autopilot. - [Gautam] Great. So kind of to summarize\\nwhat we\\'ve discussed so far: I don\\'t think the data lakes\\nare going away anytime soon. They\\'re in fact hyperscale\\nat this point, right? So, similar to how AWS, Azure and GCP are like Snowflake,\\nDatabricks of the world, the data gravity is only\\nincreasing in those platforms. And I think we touched\\non this a few times. So the legacy solutions\\nand how they approach DLP doesn\\'t really work in\\nthe world of the cloud and cloud native data lakes, really. The scale is just too massive for them to really scale as\\na classification engines. But at the same time, discovery and classification is critical. So you need really native\\nclassification solutions, but don\\'t just focus on classification. You gotta think about the data security, the entire spectrum. Think about access governance, think about, \"How do I\\ndetect risk to my data? How am I actually ensuring\\ncompliance for data that\\'s going in data lakes?\" And align it with the\\nbroader security program. Don\\'t just do this as a siloed\\ndata security initiative for the data lakes. This has to align with your\\noverall data security program. And then, this is maybe critical, and Sandeep, you may\\nhave thoughts on this. I think where we\\'ve seen\\nsecurity teams be successful is when they\\'ve positioned this as an enabler for initiatives. Especially, we are seeing\\na lot of talk around gen AI and a lot of AI initiatives. So, data security team\\ncould really be the enabler of initiatives, rather\\nthan blocking somebody from doing what they wanna\\ndo with AI applications. - [Sandeep] Yeah, it really helps if you\\'re partnering with\\nthe data and AI initiatives, and taking a sort of a proactive approach to say that these are\\nsome of the applications, and these are some of the use cases that will come out of this. If you can be creative and\\nimaginative about that, being able to preemptively unblock access to this kind of programs, that\\'ll, you know, win hearts, and you\\'ll have more partners\\nin enabling the program. - [Gautam] And start with an audit. You don\\'t have to boil the ocean. Start with a small audit,\\nand then go from there. The best practices, again,\\nthe slides will be posted, you\\'ll have access to it. We also had some handouts, a\\nfew folks may be missing them, but if you need a handout, yeah, Normalyze has them on their\\nwebsite, Normalyze.ai, and you can get a deep\\ndive on best practices for Snowflake as well. If you have any questions,\\nyou could use the microphones, or even later you could\\nreach out to Sandeep or me for more a deep dive conversation. - [Sandeep] And I think we are at time, but we are happy to hang around. - [Speaker] The mic\\'s on\\nthe floor. Any questions? (indistinct) - [Gautam] Cool.

Thank you for joining me\\ntoday at the RSA Conference. I am, as Alan said, CXO\\nadvisor to Netskope. I\\'m on a board of cybersecurity advocacy and education nonprofit\\nand a recovering CIO. So I invite you in this session to join me in reflecting on parallels between IT and cybersecurity,\\nCIOs and CISOs, and hopefully some of my\\nwar stories, anecdotes, and bruises can help you on your journey, make you think, make you\\nchuckle, make your frown, whatever that is, and take\\nsomething away with you. Before I start, a quick\\nshow of hands, if I may, who considers themselves to\\nbe a cybersecurity leader? Please hands up, very cool. And aspiring leaders\\nalso here in the room. So thank you very much. That will help me focus the conversation. Now, a disclaimer, as per\\nusual, and we can start. A few years back, my two sons age 8 and 10\\nare having a meltdown, a major meltdown because their parents would not buy them a Nintendo Switch or an Xbox for Christmas, which we refuse to do out of principle. And they were crying and\\nusing exactly the words, \"We are the odd ones out \"because everybody else in the school \"is playing together and we are excluded.\" Now in a grownup world,\\nin a world of CIO life, I am a newly appointed\\nCIO in a company reporting to the CEO and member of\\nthe executive committee. So things are starting all\\nright from the setup at least. And then comes the very\\nfirst board meeting. And guess what? The video equipment would not connect to the presenter\\'s laptop. And everybody stares at me. And the only thing I can\\nget out of my mouth is, \"Let me call the help desk.\" Fast forward 10 years, a group of CIOs, seven of us sit around the\\ntable and we talk about talent. We\\'ve all got our bruises\\nand everything else. We talk about what were the challenges? What do we have in common? And so somebody then brings up, \"I wish someone told me\\nthat the biggest enemy \"of a CIO is the AV equipment.\" You can\\'t believe the\\nrelief I had in that moment. And at the same time, that realization, I thought it was just\\nmy own utter inadequacy and incompetency and whatever. And that realization that those\\nsituations are not just us. They, in the very same way, affect others. So I hope some of my stories\\nyou\\'ll find similarities to what you are going through, challenges you are facing, and the opportunities that\\nare lying ahead of you. Now, for the CIOs looking\\nat the journey of every CIO, some of us are there,\\nsome of us on the path. What we did, we come up against? I haven\\'t seen an IT\\ndepartment that wasn\\'t blamed for something that had\\nnothing to do with us. As a cybersecurity community, how many times are you blamed\\nfor something that you say, this is really not your turf. And IT was as per usual is\\ntoo slow, too expensive, and by the way, no one knows\\nwhat we are up to anyway. And what did we need\\nto learn to shift that? Dare I take into my mouth the\\nswear words of soft skills. We needed to learn a different language. We started in tech because we wanted. I wanted to do tech. I didn\\'t come into tech\\nto make someone happy and be a counselor. So learning the new language, learning to speak with a business, and in some ways getting\\nto become trivial. So there\\'s all that sophistication that we are proud of to deliver, and yet all we want to do\\nand all people expect from us is actually to talk to them in a very real and simple terms, creating engagement platforms\\nbeyond the projects. There\\'s a drive of when\\nwe have an initiative with a particular goal, then we\\'ll get people to the table. But looking at how do we broaden this? How do we create some cadence out of that and keep those relationships? And last not least, reframing politics to\\nstakeholder management. What did it bring us as CIOs is we became or collectively on a journey from being a back office function to having a seat at the table. And the value of having\\nthat seat at a table is how about getting that\\nbudget you\\'re fighting for approved easier and with less friction? How about having different\\nconversations with a business and being able to challenge, to criticize, to suggest new ways of doing things? And how about earning a bit more money? If I am allowed to stick\\nto money and remuneration, there are two things that, and I found myself, by the way, massively underpaid at\\nsome point in my career. That\\'s not something that\\'s\\nvery particular to you. There are two aspects to any remuneration or financial compensation of our work. The universal one is broadly\\ndriven by three dimensions. The universal one is broadly\\ndriven by three dimensions. It\\'s a budget you\\'re responsible for. It\\'s a time horizon. The outcomes of your work influence is a short term tactical,\\nmidterm, or strategic, and it\\'s the scope of your work. So it is what you do. Do the outcomes form a\\nfoundation for your team, for your business unit, for the company as a whole or broaden? And there is a specific angle to CISOs, a firm called Russell Reynolds. Some of you may know\\nexecutive search consultants who are known to be hiring CISOs. They came up with a CISO\\nassessment level model, CALM. As every maturity model, it starts kinda with the basics at the bottom and progresses. So starts with a level one. I would call it a tactical CISO, in Russell Reynolds language is partial, and moving up to level four, more transformational or adaptive. And if we look at the four dimensions that distinguish the top\\nlevel CISO from the rest, is number one is automation. How good are we at automating? Especially now in the environment where the skills have\\nnever been more scarce, where the complexity\\nhas never been greater, looking at the end to end and 360 protection for your organizations. So convergence of digital and\\ncyber, physical and digital, looking at different\\nmodalities of technology, driving decision making through data and analytics insights,\\nand last not least, shaping the culture towards cyber. The leadership angle of that model. So what are the individual attributes that contribute to where you\\'re at? And if we first look at the conversations, the nature of relationships, are they transactional\\nor are they relational? The styles of interactions, are they reactive or anticipatory? And at what level does the\\norganization influence go? Is it a IT and cybersecurity\\nor is it at the level of executive committees and boards? So double-clicking on that. And of course, you see the direct relation to the remuneration of a CISO and looking at the leadership\\ncompetencies required in the upper levels. It\\'s indeed change orientation, influencing and collaboration\\nand the strategic capability. Now, truth be told, it\\'s not\\nall about us how leadership, what leadership qualities there are, but also the design of the organization and the good old risk assessment,\\nprobability and impact. Take it to the level of the organization and organizational\\'s\\nunderstanding of itself. If the probability of a compromise is low and the impact is minor, then as much as transformational CISO and cybersecurity function\\nyou want to be and you are, you end up being in the trenches and in that tension of\\nnot being that appreciated and actually being frustrated, banging your head against that wall. And so that realization of where is the organization at, what kind of CISO does\\nthe organization need as well as how does it\\nmatch my capability? Going away and reflecting on that may be a useful step in\\nyour professional journey. It certainly was one for me. And I ended up walking out\\nof one role after realizing I\\'ve done so much and transformed so much, but does the organization\\nhave the appetite long term in technology-driven transformation or would my skills be\\nbetter somewhere else? So again, asking those\\nquestions helps us grow, helps us make the right choices. So there were stories for today. I tried to cover two aspects. Number one is the day to\\nday, what are the challenges? Where did I find myself? And then looking at the\\ntransformational aspect, driving change, and making\\nsure that change is successful and sustainable as in it\\nwill sustain different cycles of organization and time. Number one, let\\'s start\\nwith the universal wisdom. Best part of my career,\\nI was focused on quality. Quality was the number one, is the values I grew up\\nwith also as a person and be it implementing new systems, be it improving service,\\nrunning a P&L, whatever that is. And I was proud to have the\\nreputation in organization of being less of a\\npolitical oriented leader. And I hated politics until I reframed what politics meant to me and changed it from its politics to acceptance. And I invite you to share\\nthat reframing with me because friction is ubiquitous\\nand people are trouble. As one VP of HR once told me, the interests of\\ndepartments, the conflict, the understanding of what\\'s important and not is by its very\\nnature, very different. And unless you find a way\\nto connect the initiative, you drive the agenda\\nthat you have to needs and wants of people around the table, you\\'ll be burning a lot of energy and yet still feel somewhat unappreciated and the whole process is rather tedious. And it took me a venting, my frustration after\\na particular situation to a colleague of mine who was working on a different team in\\nthe same company was that, do you really think that\\nsuccess equals quality? Not at all help but acceptance. If you only focus on quality,\\nyou become a busy fool. So start doing the politics, start talking to those other people and never ever disregard the\\nimportance of that soft side. I prefer these days human\\ncentric side of our roles that go outside and beyond of our teams and our immediate functions. And to exercise that influence and to look at how do we impact and get the acceptance, one of the tools I found particularly easy to start using is the,\\ncan I pick your brains? And is can I pick your brains\\nstarting with marketing? Now, marketing are a difficult stakeholder for any IT organization\\nand any cybersecurity team because they\\'re very special. They work with external creative\\nagencies and whatsoever. And before you know it, they\\'re using SaaS platforms\\nyou didn\\'t authorize and some of them you\\ndidn\\'t even know existed. But marketing also has a different angle. They are the ones who are\\nreally good at communicating. So getting that coffee with\\na colleague from marketing, whoever that is that\\nyou would pick and say, can I pick your brains\\nbefore sending out some email to employees all or to a\\nbroader group of people before doing a presentation\\nto the business and non-technical people? Pick their brains, they love it. People love being asked questions and ask for their support. And the seems valid for\\nfinance, for procurement, HR, looking at the awareness, how can HR benefit from that\\ninitiative you\\'re driving by sharing them, by sharing\\nthe credits, finance, looking at how to get the budget approved, what is their view? Do they think? Can the portfolio be shifted? Do they see any projects\\ndelayed, et cetera? So again, looking at those people and using them to create that acceptance and to help you drive your initiatives is not to be underestimated. CEOs and boards are very different. They won\\'t listen unless it is relevant. And here, the question\\nis, can I align what I do to one of the strategic\\ninitiatives of the business? Is it ESG? Is it digital trust? Some organizations indeed\\nhave zero trust initiatives at the board level that are driving those. And continue on the theme of acceptance and looking at how do we\\ninfluence organization, how do we create a reputation for our unit by what we say, but also what we do. What I found interesting is\\nthere\\'s a cybersecurity saying, never waste a good\\ncrisis that I\\'ve learned. Now, to broaden it, you\\ndon\\'t need a good crisis to start a focused intervention. And a focused intervention\\ncan be creating a platform for people who touch, who\\nare opinionated about IT, who have stake in the\\ndelivery of your function and how they get involved, how they get their say in the roadmap in what we do and how we do it. Again, from my own experience\\nwalking into a CIO role where the team had a very\\ndifficult ERP implementation, so a major software implementation\\nthat didn\\'t go well. And then looking at, okay, I need a statement towards\\na broad organization. I needed a statement towards everyone. So he was created an IT control board so we were no longer a black box, but people could see inside. We could also discuss how to prioritize and it was a joint and a shared decision. Doesn\\'t have to be a massive\\nstatement towards everyone. Your little board or committee or whatever doesn\\'t even need to have\\na name to start with. So be it two, three people\\nfrom broad organization who you meet on a regular\\nbasis or who you first meet, and then decide do you want\\nto meet with them again? How do you grow it? How do you start these\\nregular conversations, whether there\\'s one project, whether there\\'s many projects, whether it\\'s just about aligning the priorities of their functions. Why initiatives stall, some of them fail? I\\'d like to take you to a big\\nsupply chain organization, market leader, but recognizing trucks and sheds are getting\\nincreasingly commoditized. Created a new business unit to do transformational deals. So overall, market is margins, profit margins in lowest\\nsingle digit percentage. And this nearly no growth. This transformational units mandate that which was also\\nfulfilled was fivefold growth in five years and bring the deals in that kind of 10 plus\\npercent profit margin. And we checked all the boxes. So to do that, to do transformation, we needed to break a few rules. So as a VP IT of that division, I not only was responsible\\nfor kind of the classical IT, but we run IT as a P&L. So all of a sudden, we\\'re earning money by\\nselling the IT solutions. And that unit was, as I\\nsaid, super successful. And how do you think the bosses of my boss and the corporate leadership\\nliked us so much so that the managing director of that unit became chief innovation\\nofficer at the group level? But how do you think the peers,\\nthe neighboring divisions, how did they feel about\\nthat little tiny unit who they thought were\\nslightly arrogant as well as being ahead of everybody else, but not contributing the\\nvolume that they would be doing and probably also not\\nappreciating the scale and the inertia that\\nthey had to deal with. So the unit was successful to start with. And then we started running into troubles because we were the only ones\\nwho had VP of innovation. We had the only ones who had a VP for commercial engineering, et cetera. So all of a sudden, you find yourself that every single piece of\\nbusiness you\\'re bringing into the organization doesn\\'t go according to the well-oiled process\\nmachine of the company. And that\\'s what made us review and review and do iterations after iterations to make sure that it\\nactually goes somewhere. And the processes and the culture, again, the relationship at the peer level, the relationship with\\nthe broader organization as well as not creating\\nexception with every single piece of business that we did\\nthat it actually did matter. Overcoming organizational inertia, as a leader, I\\'m on fire. I\\'m here to make a change. I\\'m here to drive that change, seeing challenges, seeing opportunities, how do we do things differently now? And I see in the eyes of\\nsome of the team members at town halls, at skip meetings,\\nat some project reviews, there\\'s some that share that enthusiasm, but usually not all of the leadership team who are with you at the table that share the same enthusiasm. So how to break through that inertia where you see what needs doing and your direct reports\\nseem to be the ones who are slowing it down\\nand who are bringing in arguments why it couldn\\'t be done. So best way to do that to another project. One, two maximum of three\\nstrategic initiatives that I would be driving myself\\nand getting those people would define their eyes onto that project and without alienating\\nany of the structures and any of the leadership team. And speaking of projects, speaking of getting things done\\nand large scale initiatives, I\\'d like to take you to\\nutilities organization. Well, 35,000 employees,\\nabout 30 billion turnover. In IT, we had 1,500 people\\nand we embarked on a, dare I say, data quality exercise needed to change the way we work and improve operational efficiencies cost. I just start speaking the same language. And for that initiative, what I needed were the best people from across all the functions, infrastructure, architecture,\\nenterprise systems from digital, from the business IT, and how do you get best\\npeople onto your project who are already more than\\nbusy and where the queue of other projects waiting\\nfor them to support. Now, one of the elements that I found got me\\nthe capacity is to say, \"Can I have them for 20% of their time?\" And 20% of their time is, can somebody work on my\\nproject one week a month? And every team, every organization is used to dealing with people\\'s holidays, in the U.S. probably less so than in Europe as more holidays. But looking at how do we get\\nthose people on the board without disrupting the ongoing business. And the way they structured\\nthat initiative is, I didn\\'t go out and say,\\nlet\\'s go data cleansing and let\\'s go create the\\nprocesses, et cetera. The buy in from the IT team came from let\\'s transform the IT function from a super tanker to\\nan armada of speedboats. Let\\'s look at how can we\\ndo things differently. Selling it to the executives who were responsible\\nfor those team members and who had to contribute to the program look mid long term, your\\npayback is your lower cost. We have the opportunity to improve the service to the broader business. And by the way, we can close\\na few cybersecurity gaps such as criticality\\nassessment to start with. And making the change irreversible, again, any transformation that it\\'s\\ntaking significant amount of time that you would be driving is how do we make sure\\nthat what we put in place is not going back to the state\\nbefore the transformation. So the best designed processes may fail if the decentralized organization\\ndoesn\\'t keep that momentum and doesn\\'t keep the processes, et cetera. And one of the ways is\\nhow do you change one of the core processes of\\nthe organization to reflect that change in case of that\\ndata cleansing exercise and data quality exercise. And by the way, you can\\'t\\ndo any AI without that. There are so many topics that are very interesting\\nto the organization, but they\\'re built on\\nthe foundation of that. We changed the approach to IT budgeting. So we changed from the\\ndata center cost you X and the ERP licenses\\ncost you Y, et cetera, to what does a service cost the business, what is the billing, what is our operational\\nmaintenance, et cetera. So shifting that and starting budgeting based on our new data model, there was no way back. It had to be maintained, otherwise there would be no\\nfunds released for maintenance, for external support,\\nfor licenses, et cetera. And the brief conclusion is\\nattached on a day-to-day, And the brief conclusion is\\nattached on a day-to-day, a few day-to-day situations, a few transformational initiatives. And the big question is, what is it that actually\\nyour organization needs and what is it that your aspirations are? So where is that intersection? And looking at the takeaways and what can you reflect on how to apply, focus on self-advocacy and acceptance, looking at whose brains to pick. Is it marketing? Is it legal? Is it CFO? And how to help you with acceptance. Don\\'t be shy to create\\na committee or a board to raise awareness and\\nto help get things done. There are two parts to it, from execution again and again. So back to the fivefold growth in a commoditized environment, it\\'s the review, readjust, and sometimes take two steps\\nforward and one step back. With next top performer, you\\'ll\\nget onto your project team. How do you get them freed up? What\\'s the investment case for the executive responsible\\nfor those resources? And what are the creative constellations that you can find to get things done? Again, attaching the\\nresults of what you do to major business outcomes\\nand make them irreversible. Again, a number of war stories of cases, but one thing I\\'d like to invite you to do is reflect on what type of leader you are and what type of leader\\ndoes organization needs. And the first step is, is\\nit something do you want to go onto educational\\njourney and explain to them that there\\'s a different\\nopportunity for them, or is it something to be\\nrealistic with yourself and take actions as you see fit? Write down three important stakeholders and what do you want\\nthem to know about you, self-advocacy, acceptance? You\\'re not doing it just for yourself. And that was my biggest resistance. We\\'re doing it for our teams. We\\'re doing it for our functions and for the broad organization. And last not least,\\nhere\\'s a coffee drinker, coffee addict speaking, get\\na coffee with marketing. Yeah, every single time as\\nirritating some of them are or maybe that that\\'s the best\\nasset for our communication and they\\'re so grateful to\\nbe asked and to be involved in order to be thrown\\nsomething over the heads. So that\\'s it for me for today and opening floor for\\nquestions if you have any. Thank you. (audience applauding) - [Woman] So I got 20% negotiated with the senior leadership,\\nwith the senior management. And that was the long-term benefit. Your payback is we reduce the cost. Your team will have less\\nfriction operationally and the customers will feel better. But the conviction of the team was people support what they create. At the team level, there was\\na lot of their contribution, their working, their jointly\\nprioritizing, et cetera, to get them brought into the purpose of what they were doing. Thank you very much, thank you. - [Man] Thank you, everyone.', 'drive': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mgUWaMTujmHmRHUSxzeU1fnqI_24Vu2J'}, {'url': 'https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2024/exposure%20the%205th%20annual%20rsac%20soc%20report', 'title': 'EXPOSURE: The 5th Annual RSAC SOC Report', 'date': 'May 09, 2024', 'text': \"In this session, we will share the experiences of monitoring the RSAC wireless network from the Security Operations Center.

Welcome to RSA Conference 2024. This is the fifth annual SOC Report. So, my name is Steve Fink. I\\'m here with my colleagues,\\nJessica Bair Oppenheimer and Steven Baer. So, we\\'re here to tell you- - [Jessica] That we\\'re not related. - Yeah. (laughs)\\n(audience laughing) We\\'re here to tell you\\nabout all of the traffic that you guys generate,\\nwhile you\\'re on this network. - [Steve Baer] So, first\\nthe disclaimer, right? Like any of these events, right? Everything is monitored. We\\'re watching your traffic. You saw the signs as\\nyou guys came in, right? So, free wireless available and the next one and the\\ncode of conduct, right? So this all falls under the umbrella of just because you can,\\ndoesn\\'t mean you should, right? But there you have it. You were warned and we monitor it and we collected some\\nreally interesting data. - [Steve Fink] So let me tell you a little bit about our team. So, our team is made up of\\nindustry professionals. Several of us, we travel the world together, we work additional conferences. We started this particular SOC here, at RSA Conference. After, RSA Conference\\ncame to us at Black Hat and said, \"Hey, we love what\\nyou\\'re doing at Black Hat, so why don\\'t you come do it for us too?\" And we said, okay, cool, we\\'ll do that. So, this year we have\\nfive NetWitness analysts, 10 Cisco and Splunk analysts,\\none IBM threat Hunter, and then us three. So, here\\'s a little bit\\nof a view inside our SOC. So, we have the monitors. Obviously, everybody loves dashboards. You know, we don\\'t have\\nany pewpew maps, sorry. We get a whole crowd of\\npeople coming around. We do talk about everything.\\nWe give multiple SOC tours. I think we did nine this year. Nine SOC tours, press interviews. We talk, we evangelize cybersecurity. And what\\'s super unique about this, is we have an environment where everyone should be a\\ncybersecurity professional. So that means we should\\nnot see anything, right? (audience laughing)\\n- Right. - [Steve Fink] So, the way we do it, is we get a span from Moscone. We only are looking at the wifi, which is specifically your traffic, right? The attendees are on the conference wifi. So we\\'re looking for bad stuff and we find it. So, the way we bring it in on that span, we put that into a switch. From that switch, we put it in what\\'s\\nnormally a reverse mode of a mirror, right? We bring in one port and we\\nsplit out to multiple tools. So we put the switch into backwards mode. - [Jessica] Thanks so much. It\\'s been a real honor\\nto work with NetWitness, since 2017, on the\\nSecurity Operations Center here at RSA Conference. It\\'s grown as the conference has evolved. It started as an educational\\nexperience where, hey, this is what\\'s on the network and maybe you shouldn\\'t do that. And we\\'ve actually expanded over the years to be an integral part\\nof the security team, here at RSA conference. We coordinate with the\\nphysical security team, with the network operations team, with those that are actually\\nrunning the conference as well. And that we\\'ve, over the years, we\\'ve increased the number of tools that we brought in there. You see the Splunk and the Security Cloud, with the breach protection, user protection, cloud protection. And also we have a number of partners who donate licenses for\\nthreat intelligence. When we\\'re looking at\\nthese different events, we can correlate that with Recorded Future, alpha\\nmagnetic ai, Pulse, Dive, IBM X-Force Exchange and community tools. So when we\\'re looking\\nat a particular threat, we can understand and\\nwhat that context is. So we have to allow you to go and do the cool nasty stuff that you want to do in\\nyour demonstrations, the trainings that you\\ngo to, the briefings. \\'cause if we were blocking stuff, then that would be a really sad day. - [Steve Fink] And what\\'s\\nthis all look like? - [Jessica] Exactly, right? So we\\'re gonna get into the topology, which a lot of folks are\\nkind of wondering about. So what we do, is before\\nthe conference starts, we deploy virtual appliances inside the network\\noperation center, for DNS, to have that visibility. So all the DNS requests,\\nwhen you go to Google and it translates to 8.8.8.8. So we don\\'t have to be computers. We can type in that name of where we want to go on the internet. And that is all passed\\nthrough there for visibility. And also, we can understand\\nwhat type of traffic the conference attendees need to go to. Have those statistics to share with you, which we\\'re gonna do today. And then we have that SPAN port, which Steve\\'s gonna talk more about. - [Steve Fink] So, as the traffic comes in from the SPAN port, we split it out into multiple tools. One of those tools being NetWitness. NetWitness is really our\\nsingle source of truth when it comes to the packet because it\\'s port and protocol agnostic. It records everything. We also pump in the\\nlogs from the firewalls and our other devices, all into NetWitness where that data can be correlated with a common set of metadata. From that metadata, we then\\nshare it with the other tools. - [Jessica] So that\\'s going in. We have the logs coming in from DNS, from the secure access going\\ninto NetWitness and the logs, you also have the firewall,\\nwhich Steve talked about. And then that\\'s coordinated with Splunk. All of that metadata, of the network detection and response, is correlated there and\\nmakes it searchable. And then what brought us together, it\\'s been over 10 years that\\nwe\\'ve been working together, with NetWitness, about\\nthis malware analysis. - [Steve Fink] Yeah. So\\nour original integration, was with the product formerly\\nknown as Threat Grid. Now Cisco Malware Analytics. This was our first integration. So we had these two tools and we would utilize NetWitness\\nto pull any binaries, that are unique. And so, if we\\'ve never seen it before, we\\'ll pull that binary out and we will send it to Threat Grid, Cisco Malware and Analytics. And we will find out, is this\\nbenign, or is this a threat? And it will return a score,\\ntelling us that information. We ingest that data into NetWitness and then we share it with\\nall the other components within the platform. - [Jessica] So what\\nthat allows us to do is, we can work with a file that comes through without becoming affected. Detonates your malware on\\nour network instead of yours. The same thing when\\nwe\\'re looking at domains. A number of domains came in,\\nthat were really suspicious, that we were doing investigations. We can put inside the sandbox, with an integrated threat intelligence, without getting our machines infected. Every once in a while\\nwe\\'ll have a newer person. And he is like, I looked it up. I\\'m like, \"Whoa, stop. Remember,\\n(Steve Fink laughs) do it in the sandbox and not on your machine,\\nyour corporate network.\" Right? So although, so those\\nfirewall events are going in, through analytics, for incident generation and that\\'s all coming into\\nthe extended detection and response XDR. We coordinate with each other in Slack. We have automation. - [Steve Fink] Yep. We have a lot of automations\\nthat end up in Slack, where we can share information. We can actually request\\nadditional information from the tools in Slack as well. And those requests are passed\\non to the appropriate tool. - [Jessica] And then the Recorded Future, donated additional license, so that we could have their\\nintegration with Splunk and have that correlation\\nof the threat intelligence with all those logs and then all those threat\\nintelligence sources coming together. So hold it there. I know that\\'s of high interest. To the folks also, this is being recorded. The presentation will be posted and we\\'ll be doing a\\nsecurity operations report, this summer, after it goes\\nthrough conference legal and the other legal teams. It\\'s so interesting when\\nwe write those reports because we don\\'t wanna do\\na wall of shame or sheep, but there\\'s sometimes where we need to have really difficult conversations with security companies,\\nabout their security posture. So we always give them a\\nchance to talk about it, to respond to it, and even to fix their stuff\\nbefore we publish that. - [Steve Fink] So, within NetWitness, we have multiple components. Normally, in an enterprise, these would be on separate appliances and they would be spread out to handle the load of whatever capacity is necessary to take in. Here, we\\'re in a hurry, we\\nhave to build it quickly. So we kind of truncate\\nthat, just a little bit. And we put it just on three appliances. So, two of the appliances\\nare designed for ingest and creation of the metadata. And then we put all the other components in a virtualized environment,\\non the other appliance. And that\\'s what makes up\\nthe NetWitness platform. - [Steve Baer] So, from an analyst view, we start out with ingesting\\nsome of this data. We get the dashboards\\nup and running, right? You can see incidents and then the alerts, and then dive down into\\nall those details, right? And start to look at the threats, analyzing some of those issues. Start to hone in on where\\nthe traffic\\'s coming from, what it\\'s doing, right? And then finally, start to hunt. Go in, look at things in a backward compatibility perspective. Color, context. Have we seen it before? Have we not seen it\\nbefore? What\\'s it doing? What\\'s its ultimate goal? - [Steve Fink] So, what Steve mentioned, threat hunting, right? So, we have a whole team of threat hunters and the threat hunters and their purpose within the SOC, is to actually look for\\nthe unknown bad, right? So, we have that human element, where the human looks at some data and says, man, that looks weird. And then they really\\nstart digging into it. So it was, I believe 2018. Quarantine makes time weird, right? We actually found a C2 infrastructure that was using 404 errors, as command and control traffic, right? And that was just simply an analyst, sitting in front of the\\nscreen, looking at it and looking and why are we\\ngetting all these 404 errors? Like this person\\'s just pounding and wait, I got this person\\nhitting the same site and they\\'re getting a 404 and they\\'re getting a 404. 404, 404 everywhere. But the bite counts kept changing. So he was like, this is weird. And so he started digging into it and we found an entire C2 infrastructure. We walked down, we had\\na chat with the FBI, they had a chat with\\nthe NSA, they came over, we pulled some P caps, sent it off with them, and before the end of the conference, they had dismantled\\nthat C2 infrastructure. So, here\\'s the kind of the what happens with the files, right? So we get a binary file, it comes out, we process those uniques\\nlike I mentioned before. And so, we saw 544 different files, that we thought could\\npotentially be malicious. We actually sent 50 of\\nthose up to Threat Grid and we brought them back and had a result, whether\\nthey were benign or malicious. And we found some very unique malware. Are we... Dead again. - [Jessica] Just the little logos. So the other part of the infrastructure is the firewall. I wanna give a shout out to Brian there. Built the original SOC in the box here, back in the Cisco Threat Wall. We\\'ve been sharing\\ninfrastructure for a while and are able to deploy all\\nthis gear, in about a day because of having the span,\\nthe switch, the firewall, the storage, the Splunk,\\nall this stuff in one place. So we\\'re in intrusion detection mode. We could be blocking stuff, of course then you wouldn\\'t\\nhave your great conference, where you detect those events. And some of the other things that we do, is the number of unique hosts. You see here that Apple\\nis leading the way, 17,000 unique devices\\nconnected to the network since Monday, when we first came on. So with that, we\\'re able\\nto see threat intelligence, you know, attempts for intrusion. If it\\'s something that we\\nneed to dig into deeper, then our analysts will do that. And if we have to take appropriate action. The other thing that we institute, this year is Splunk integration. So this is integration, here\\nfirst with Recorded Future, with that threat intelligence. And then we also had an\\nintegration with NetWitness, be able to have that metadata. And this is showing\\ndifferent types of attack, paths and vectors that are coming in. We also integrated with\\nthe malware analysis and extended detection and response and something new, which is\\ncalled multi-cloud defense. \\'cause some of our infrastructure we need to put up into the cloud. We want to make sure that\\nthat is secure, firewall, with integrations. And then of course with the firewall. So what having those dashboards and aggregation allows our team members to focus more on threat hunting and then to see the alerts\\nthat come up on the dashboards, as they happen. So this is the extended\\ndetection and response where we\\'re able to see\\nthe number of files, the flow, security events, DNS events. If something like comes up as blocked, that really gets our attention because by default we don\\'t block. Last year we actually had a block occur. Like why? Did we mess something up? Did we misconfigure something? It was because there\\'s\\ncertain illegal activity, that we can\\'t even turn\\noff that blockings. Some folks had tried to go to websites that are illegal, illegal. We worked with the\\nnetwork operations center to see where they went. We could track all the way\\nthrough the conference, according to the access\\npoints and when they left and then when they came back and talked to law enforcement\\nas appropriate, in that case. So some of the things we\\ncan do with this, is dig in. This is a scanning, we\\'ll talk\\nabout that in a little bit. But this is what it looks like when one person decides\\nto scan this open network. And it helps us identify,\\nvery quickly visualize that and then get a summary\\nreport for the analysts. Especially, we will\\noccasionally bring in new folks to come and learn in this environment, next to our seasoned people. And it just describes, hey, this is what it means in very\\neasy to understand language. This is the new\\ninfrastructure that we put up. The firewall for the cloud, so that we could have that infrastructure of some of this integrations that we saw all those point arrows to. So that is secure because we\\ndon\\'t want to leak data there. Another thing new is the\\ntax service management. What this does, is it shows you, here\\'s all of the different tools that you have in your\\nsecurity operations center. This is how they relate to each other. Here\\'s how they\\'re sharing APIs. This is how they\\'re communicating, to make sure that we don\\'t\\nhave stuff that\\'s spelled out, that hard coded in, or different aspects that may\\nbe particularly vulnerable, or that gap assessment. And that\\'s what it looks like when you\\'re doing your gap assessment. So that\\'s the infrastructure. Let\\'s talk about statistics, right? Let\\'s talk about traffic-\\n- Stats, stats, stats - [Jessica] Stats. Not SOC stats. - [Steve Baer] So, not surprisingly, things are trending, right? In some cases trending down, right? So think about the post\\nCOVID years, right? Not pulling as much data as\\nwe had in the past, right? But still seeing some\\nvery unique things, right? So, when you start to look at total number of sessions. Down, right? But it is a conference, right? And we\\'re not necessarily\\ndoing a lot of the things that we would be doing because\\nwe\\'re security professionals and we hook up to a network. And probably a lot of\\nyou folks have actually, if you have hooked up to the network, it\\'s your demo stations, it\\'s your, what you\\'re showing off at the conference. It\\'s probably not your\\npersonal event, right? Or your personal life. But you\\'ll see some intersections\\nwhere that changes, right? We captured a lot of logs, right? 39 million, we captured a lot of packets. All of that goes into that\\nanalysis hopper, right? Allows us to do some really interesting\\nthings with that data. Bandwidth peaks you can\\nsee there as well, right? And then come down and\\nlook at detection, right? Year over year. We trend, accordingly. We see some interesting\\nspikes during the day too. And there\\'s also some interesting\\nintersections of traffic in and out of and around\\nthe the Moscone Center. Okay? - [Steve Fink] So one\\nof the common questions that we get asked every year is, what do you do with this\\ndata at the end of it? Can I buy it? And the answer is no. So immediately upon the finish of today, we\\'re gonna head over and we start destroying\\nall this data, right? So we have a commitment\\nto both you as attendees and RSA Conference that\\nwe will destroy the data. The first year we did this,\\nI cried, we cried a lot. So we literally, physically destroyed over a hundred thousand\\ndollars in hard drives, punched a hole right through \\'em, with a massive hydraulic press and there were a lot of tears. - [Jessica] It was streamed live on Facebook.\\n- Yes, yeah. - [Steve Baer] Looked\\nlike a bad rendition of Office Space.\\n- Fortunately- - Yeah. (chuckles)\\n- We were able to convince RSA conference that, that physical destruction\\nwasn\\'t necessary. We do put all of the drives, everything through a 13 level, DOD capable wipe. So, when we get done, it\\'ll all be gone. Now, if you notice, we\\'ve\\ntrended up this year, for encrypted traffic and\\nthat\\'s great, that\\'s fantastic. We wanna see a hundred percent, all of it. A hundred percent encrypted. But as Steve mentioned, adding\\nthe COVID, we became lax and then we actually went\\ndown, we went down steeply. So, we are working on getting better. We are working on going up. Jessica and I have the\\nopportunity to travel globally. So we do see different\\nregions. The US is the worst. So it\\'s US, UK and anything in Asia. So, keep getting better. Use the VPN. I gotta have all the pie charts. So, we do break it down. So if you see all these\\ndifferent protocols, this\\'ll be on the final report. You can watch the recording,\\nyou can pause it, everything. No need to go into all that. But we break it all out. Like literally we have detail upon detail. - [Steve Baer] So (chuckles) passwords, right? - [Jessica] We got a few. - [Steve Baer] Yeah, we\\'ve\\ngot some really good ones and some really not so good ones. And then we\\'ve got a lot of applications that are using things\\nin clear text, right? We\\'re security professionals, people, what are we doing? So, interestingly enough, right, the accounts are out there, right? 400 and some accounts, right? Very unique, clear text passwords, 36,000. Now, you might wanna say that, that\\'s part of like your demo station. Or you might wanna blame\\nyour marketing people. Or maybe the SE in the booth\\nis just working really hard and you give \\'em a little credit but... In the grand scheme of things, when you watch how all these\\nthings unfold in the real world and this analysis is all\\nthat more popular, right? Think about where these devices are going after this conference. Think about the things you\\'re\\ndoing in your personal life. Like my esteemed colleague,\\nMr. Fink mentioned. Use the VPN, right? Use the right applications. And again, like I said earlier, just \\'cause you can\\ndoesn\\'t mean you should. And this applies here. Okay. - [Jessica] So, we have the\\nvirtual appliances for DNS, in the network operation center. We\\'re able to see the number of statistic, we see the trends. The last one that looks\\nlike we\\'re below this year, but that was at 11:00 AM. So by three o\\'clock tear down, we know that this will go above it. The other little thing to the side is, how much would\\'ve been blocked, if we were in a production environment. So we did not do the blocking. But you can see from here, and I\\'ll make it a\\nlittle bit bigger there, that these are the number of events that would\\'ve been blocked by default. There\\'s a, you see some of\\nthem are newly seen domains that\\'ve been up for training. Your production environment. That\\'s a way that you can\\nenhance your securities, if something\\'s been spun up recently because it\\'s part of\\nthe tech infrastructure. Unless of course you\\'re Mr. Fink and he buys domains, just to have them, so that they\\'re old by the\\ntime he wants to use \\'em for exploitation, which is\\nanother thing you can do. - [Steve Fink] I may have 50 or so, maybe. So.\\n- Some other things that we\\'ll do on there, which is command control. Those with shared phishing\\nattacks, crypto mining. By default, those would\\nall have been blocked. But we allow you to have those experiences and if you want to crypto\\nmine while you\\'re here, knock yourself out. So applications are something that we started tracking a few years ago. These are unique applications that have connected to the network. We\\'ve seen that they have\\ncontinued to go up over the years. We\\'re double where we were. But you know, this conference was right\\nbefore the world shut down, four years ago. You may have got that email like I did. Like you may have been\\nexposed to someone with COVID, as you recall that. But we\\'ve over doubled\\nthe number of applications connected to the network. What\\'s interesting is we\\nhave 17,000 unique users. In the past we\\'ve had up to\\n40,000 unique devices connected. So, the number of devices have gone down as people have started like, maybe I\\'ll use my hotspot, or maybe I\\'ll bring my, I don\\'t want to use this conference wifi. \\'cause it\\'s a flat network\\nwith no segmentation. Someone could be sniffing it with Wireshark like we\\'re\\nusing it with NetWitness. Of course we destroy our\\ndata. They might not. But that\\'s what we encourage you, to use these proper protocols. Because if when you go to Starbucks, when you go to your hotel,\\nwhatever you\\'re doing there, is the same that you\\'re doing here. One thing that we did note is\\nthe number of Slack channels. Those have really grown. There are almost 3,600 unique\\nSlack channels being used, here at the conference. With these apps, they\\'re categorized into\\ndifferent risk categories. If we had to shut one down because there was a threat happening, that were notified by the\\nphysical security team, or the network team, or the conference. We could shut that down at the\\napp level, should that arise. So AI, right? Did you guys go to any\\npresentations this week that didn\\'t include AI? So of course I have to talk about it, but it\\'s what you\\'re using\\nis what I want to talk about. These are the top AI apps that were used at the conference\\nhere, including Notion. You see it\\'s a high risk\\nand that\\'s about sharing. \\'cause this is at the mindset\\nof being in the corporation, or an organization, or government entity. It\\'s like if you are\\npasting stuff in there because you\\'re trying\\nto do your work email, or something, then whoa,\\nyou know, be careful there. So those are some of the the\\nthings that we have seen. Obviously, some of those vendors are here and they would love you\\nto use their technology. It\\'s got that point of our briefing where cuddle up to someone next\\nto you, who you like, or get to know someone else because we\\'re gonna go into story time. Some of the things that\\nwe\\'ve seen on the network, that we probably hope we shouldn\\'t. First thing is we like\\nto give our awards out, about the most commonly used\\nwebsites or applications. So, we have the, Apple has now the become\\nthe most highly used application infrastructure\\nat the conference. Displacing Google and Microsoft of years past. As we may have seen from the Ink devices, that majority of devices\\nconnecting to the conference wifi, were from Apple. Mchat though, holds the lead from Google. They displaced WhatsApp a couple years ago and they still are there. Crypto mining, we always\\nget to learn about new stuff that people are using their machines for to make a little money on the side. Whether they know it or not, maybe someone else is making the money on their thing. At Black Hat, we actually have\\na cap portal, crypto mining. We\\'ll send you a notification like, \"by the way, you\\'re crypto mining, if that\\'s what you want to do, you\\'re great, otherwise someone\\nelse is using your stuff.\" So click here.\\n(audience laughing) Yeah. So, a few years ago, this conference was over Valentine\\'s Day and we saw a lot of\\nlove stuff in the clear. And also at the time\\nTinder was allowing you to see the pictures of\\nright left, in the clear. So we actually, NetWitness\\nteam put up a script, to see who were the the yes, (audience laughing)\\nand who were the, who were the like, or the pal. Left or right swipe. - [Steve Fink] And, yeah, there was an attendee\\nhere who happened to be a Member of Congress and he\\nheard our little story. And so he sent a letter off\\nto Match.com and he said WTF. So Match.com, tried to fix it. So we had the challenge\\non the next go round of the next show to try and find it. And we still had it. So, it did get better after that. From show one, to show two. In show one we could\\nactually see the pictures. In show two, we just had\\nto gather the telemetry and still go left or right. Another iteration, back\\nand forth with Match.com. And it\\'s now fixed and\\nyou\\'re safe. We don\\'t know. - [Steve Baer] If you ever wanna watch a, or if you ever see a threat\\nhunter jump out of his seat, chances are he is looking at something, that somebody else is looking at and he is really not\\ncomfortable with what they see. (audience chuckles)\\n- You know and Tinder was displaced, four years ago as the number one with grindr. No commentary on that.\\n(audience laughs) We do give awards of the, what you\\'re doing at the conference, besides paying attention to us. We used to give awards of this for the shorter session\\nand longer session. But someone complained that we did that. So we don\\'t do that anymore.\\n(audience laughs) - [Steve Fink] We did get a complaint about the content of our presentation and we\\'re like... - [Jessica] We\\'re just\\nreporting what you people do. We used to put all the\\nplain text JPEGs up there, but then we had to stop doing that as well because, thanks guys. (Steve Fink laughs) All right, moving on.\\nLet\\'s talk about scanning. It\\'s not a crime but\\nsometimes it\\'s just not a, it\\'s like what the F over. So there\\'s a lot of scanning\\ngoing on in this network. You can see here, this\\nis what we\\'re seeing inside the firewall with that scanning and the protocols that are being used. You know, the UDP, ICMP, TCMP and so on. There\\'s a particular vendor down there that has a portable scanner\\nand they brought it last year and we saw, found their MAC\\naddress and where they were and went and talked to \\'em like, yes you can do it, but should you do it? And this year they\\'re back and they\\'re using the same MAC address. So that was pretty easy to find.\\n(audience laughs) So we- - [Steve Fink] It\\'s a really\\ngood tool. It really is. They just have it put in aggressive mode. And this is not an environment\\nto be in aggressive mode. - [Jessica] Where we would step in, is what we\\'ve seen\\nthese other conferences, is they start scanning outside the network and hitting other infrastructure. Or actually attacking infrastructure that haven\\'t set up for a demo, outside. As Steve said, if it\\'s illegal\\noutside of the conference, it\\'s illegal here. So, don\\'t do that. And this one, I just wanna shame \\'em. But we\\'re not going to. - [Steve Fink] Oh. What do we do? What do we do? So, this particular application, we\\'re now one year later and people still believe that\\nthis is a cybersecurity tool and it leaks data like nobody\\'s\\nbusiness and they\\'re...it. We just don\\'t know.\\n- Major sponsor this conference. - [Steve Fink] They\\'re a major sponsor. We spoke to \\'em last\\nyear, nothing\\'s changed. We\\'ve talked to \\'em a couple\\nother times. Nothing\\'s changed. So, we have to consult the lawyers. - [Jessica] We may, they may be in the stock finance report this summer. We\\'re gonna give them another opportunity to officially respond, before\\nwe name them in the report. But it\\'s one of those things where be aware of what your product does. There was an endpoint management tool that was used here a few years ago that was doing complete inventory of everything on the disc, vulnerability state and stuff like that. It took what, three years talking to them- - [Steve Fink] It did take us three years of talking to them. They were engaged after this first year. It took us a year to\\nfinally get some engagement and some conversation. But as cybersecurity professionals, you can go back to your organization and buy a tap on Amazon for, you know, 40 bucks and plug in your laptop and capture all your\\ntraffic on a Wireshark. You don\\'t have to have the\\nbig infrastructure that we do. You can see this stuff, right?\\n- He\\'s talking about 80 terabytes of storage\\nthat we have in the back. - [Steve Fink] I can go to Starbucks and steal your data and I\\ncan see this stuff, right? So if it\\'s out there, it\\'s out there. And we want to help these applications. We\\'re not trying to shame them. We\\'re not trying to shame any\\nattendee at the conference, anybody like that. We want to help evangelize and\\nmake the world a safer place. - [Jessica] And with that, let\\'s talk about how you\\'re not secure. So, I don\\'t know if you can read Korean, but that\\'s an insurance document for 835 million Juan to do gold transfers and it has all the information\\nyou need of the insured, who\\'s the insurance company,\\nit\\'s things like that. They\\'re translated into English. So we started digging into it and then found that also,\\nthe complete pipeline report was going through the clear with Excel. We also found purchase\\norders, again in Korean. This has the name of the\\nCEO, their email address, what they\\'re buying, how they\\'re doing it, everything that you need to do, have for a spear phishing attack. To own this infrastructure, of this. And so we dug in deeper,\\nwe saw it with the firewall \\'cause it came through as a unknown. It could have been malicious of PDFs \\'cause you make PDFs malicious obviously. Just like we could take this\\ninformation, craft A PDF that was malicious, to go in and attack any\\nof these folks here. And then we asked our\\nNetWitness folks like, \"hey, can you take a look\\nand see what this is?\" - [Steve Fink] Yeah, so\\nwe dig in and we dig in and we dig in and we have the URL, HTTP, everything. We have this screenshot, or whatnot-\\n- The name of the company. - [Steve Fink] So, the company\\nname is in this, right? So I walked down to their booth\\nand I had a chat with them and they\\'re like, oh\\nman, that looks weird. That\\'s our old logo. That\\'s not our URL. It turns out it\\'s their VAR, reselling their product and\\nit\\'s configured insecurely. So they have a good product. But the VAR made a mistake, right? And it\\'s all too often\\nwe make that mistake, as cybersecurity professionals, to forget to check that box, right? We\\'ve worked with a\\nnumber of MFA providers, that had a default policy of fail open versus fail close. It\\'s just the box. Check the box, right? And so, you work with them and the default becomes secure and you have to work to make it insecure. Right? - [Jessica] So, in this case,\\ntalking to your partners, just kinda doing audit of how they\\'re implementing\\nyour technology. \\'cause it was designed to,\\nthis is a Samsung device, as you saw in the packet capture up there. It was, had a board red. They\\'re thinking that\\nthey\\'re here in San Francisco and they wanted to securely\\nlook at their documents, but it is being insecure. So, we also found that there\\'s a way that you can find a love,\\nif you\\'re not using grindr and you want to find people\\nwho like the same music, that you do and get to know other people because you have similar tastes. The issue is that you\\'re\\nsharing it with the entire world because it is in the clear of\\nwhat your music choices are. That may not be something\\nthat concerned about, but, obviously it should be-\\n- And we actually think this one\\'s by design. Looking at the traffic, it seems like it\\'s intended\\nto function that way. - [Jessica] Go figure. So let\\'s talk about email. (Steve Fink laughs) I really thought this was dead. POP3, for serious. Why does Siri even support it? Turn it off. (group laughing) There\\'s a lot of POP3, that we saw in this case. If you go to the farmer\\'s market, or maybe outside, there\\'s someone said, \"Hey, do you want to\\nhelp kids with cancer?\" Sign your name here. And then they get a\\ndollar for the signatures \\'cause it\\'s for some ballot thing. And they\\'re outside\\ncanvassing, using our wifi. But we\\'re reading their emails because they\\'re using POP3. (audience chuckling) So, some of the things\\nthat we see is when, it\\'s called retrospective alerting, which is something comes through again, the firewalls are not blocking. Even if they were, in line and\\ndoing intrusion prevention, sometimes you need to let things through for connectivity and for speed. So in this case, something came through, it went through the sandbox\\nand the sandbox figured out, \"Hey, this actually is bad.\" We had over 50,000 files that\\nwere checked in in this way, of things that were\\ncoming, inspected by that. And then it will let, also let us know, hey, this is, if there\\nwas any lateral movement. So someone downloaded this,\\nin your corporate environment, you would\\'ve stopped it because it has this risk\\nscore of 95 out a of hundred. And that\\'s because it\\'s using\\nsome DLLs and other artifacts that are used by known Trojans. We will of course allow you to do that, if that\\'s how you want to spend your time, or to do a demonstration in a corporate world with (indistinct). But if it started again, laterally moving, as we\\ncan see that trajectory, then we would take action, accordingly. - [Steve Baer] This might\\nbe a little bit disturbing, for some folks. Here\\'s someone that had the\\nbest of intentions, right? Securing their home,\\nsecuring their family, right? But the reality is, is their whole camera\\nsystem is in the clear. Right? These are thumbnails. \\'cause we can\\'t show you the full images. Right? We\\'re security professionals. Again, you\\'re hooked up to a free network. It\\'s kind of like hooking up to the free network at the airport. You\\'re probably safer licking\\nthe floor at the airport, then you are hooking up to the network.\\n(audience laughs) Right? So think about the applications\\nthat you\\'re using, right? What\\'s going through those applications? Exercise a little bit of due diligence and keep your kids safe. - [Steve Fink] So sometimes,\\nit\\'s not just you, you have to worry about, right? So this particular scenario, this person\\'s sending\\nand receiving emails. They\\'re being sent and\\nreceived in the clear, but this is three of their colleagues. Next one. - [Jessica] Yeah. In this case, this is actually a GET\\nrequest, by a major airline, which is a member of alliance\\nthat I\\'m a member of, that is serving these up in the clear. - [Steve Fink] Yeah. So they\\'re receiving their\\ncolleagues\\' flight information, boarding passes, everything. They\\'re still inbound,\\nthey\\'re not even here yet. - They\\'re flying today.\\n- And their data\\'s being freely given away\\nby their other colleagues. So, you know, we gotta take\\ncare of each other here. - [Steve Baer] All right. So, this was again the\\nwireless policy, right? And we always recommend, use a VPN. - Did we mention that?\\n- Yes. Several times. Did we say use a VPN? (audience laughs) No.\\n- Can we talk about VPNs for just a second? Things that we\\'ve seen in the past, we found VPNs that they\\'re\\nsecurely encrypted, but they pass the password in the clear. So that\\'s been a struggle. We\\'ve also seen VPNs\\nthat do split tunneling because it\\'s like great, some traffic, we don\\'t want to be encrypted because we just wanna make it faster and maybe like the audio\\nvisual, or stuff like that. But then it\\'s misconfigured. So everything goes in the clear, are some of the struggles that we found. Again about that trust with verify. - [Steve Baer] Yeah. Use a personal firewall again, right? That\\'s all, it\\'s on half of the devices. It\\'s on all the devices we own. You just have to turn it on, right? Stay up to date on your patches, your fixes, right? - [Steve Fink] Just not\\nhere. Do it before you come. - [Steve Baer] Yeah. You don\\'t wanna learn how to fight, in the middle of the\\nfight, as we like to say. Check your security\\nconfiguration settings, right? Update your passwords,\\nuse strong passwords. Again, back to the the other original one. - [Jessica] And,\\nmultifactor authentication. - Questions.\\n- So with that we have time for questions.\\n- Yeah, there\\'s a couple microphones here, if you feel like you want to\\ncome up and ask a question. - It\\'s back.\\n- Sorry. - [Jessica] It\\'s all good. - [Steve Fink] Go ahead, sir. - [Audience Member 1] You\\nwere talk- (clears throat) Yep. Okay. You were talking about some\\nof the things that you do. Where you muse about saying, or interjecting into the channel. Do you really think you ought to do this? Have you actually contemplated moving forward with that idea? - [Steve Fink] So we do that at Black Hat. So Black Hat, we control\\nthe actual infrastructure. So we have the firewalls and other components and we control those. So we\\'ve automated that process\\nbecause I\\'m only one human. Jessica\\'s only one human. And we can only see so many\\nprofessionals at one time, right? And so what we did was, we took that use case of notification of individuals of problems on their machine, and we automated it. So, by using the automation, we actually are able to do\\nsome pretty cool things. So, the automation pops up\\na captive portal, right? And there\\'s just a okay button, much like this one, just continue, right? And it says a message and each message is unique, for what they\\'re infected\\nwith or what\\'s going on. So if you have malware,\\nit pops up and it says, \"Hey, we\\'ve detected\\nmalware on your computer. If you would like to drop by, we can maybe assist you with that.\" Everything then the, it\\'s different message for crypto mining. \\'cause you may want to be crypto mining, but we\\'re gonna notify you anyway. And so it pops up and says, \"Hey, we have detected crypto mining happening on your laptop. If this is intended behavior, simply click okay and move on.\" And so we\\'ve gotten, I think\\nwe have five different things, that we\\'ve written a script for. There are times that I\\'ve written nice little love notes to people. You know, \"Hey, what\\nyou\\'re doing is illegal, it\\'s a crime. If you would like to continue doing this, I will bring the FBI and visit you.\" And you give their host name. Right? And so it just automated\\nthat notification process. I also get less arguments that way. So, I used to go and visit,\\nyou know, a classroom, or something and I would tell, you know, tap \\'em on the shoulder. \"Hey, you know, I\\'m reading your email.\" And they\\'d argue with me and I\\'d tell \\'em their password and you owe $457,000 on your mortgage and you just signed up to\\ntake your kid to college, and all this stuff. And then suddenly they\\nbecome very interested. I\\'ve literally, we looked up, what was it last year? Maybe, they all run together. We found a gentleman here\\nthat was renewing his CISSP and we had all his information. So I called him up and I\\nleft him a detailed voicemail because it\\'s Harvard-\\n- And he didn\\'t call me back. - [Jessica] Yeah, his Harvard edu email. Yeah, all his work email. We were, he was able to call him\\nbecause his CSSP renewal had his full contact information on there. - [Steve Fink] So the next day he came and visited us at the SOC and attended one of the tours\\nand then we got him secure. And yet again, it was a checkbox. - [Jessica] Yeah, it was\\nemail aggregation tool. - [Audience Member 1] An an\\ninteresting evolution of that, would be like with the senator that you were talking about. Maybe, and it sounds like you\\nwere doing that with Match. But have you contemplated\\nmaybe notifying the service? \"Hi, you are doing your members\\na disservice, in this way.\" - [Steve Fink] Well, so\\nMatch.com is a parent company for several of the apps. So, this particular one, was one of their subsidiary companies. And so, you know, he worked\\nthat out that, you know, we saw his data in that app and so he contacted Match.com on his own. We weren\\'t even involved\\nin that conversation. He might have panicked, might have been married, I don\\'t know. Maybe. - Right. Thank you.\\n- Cheers. - [Audience Member 2] Hello. My question\\'s about how you counted the\\nnumber of Slack channels. I figure that Slack mostly\\noperates over HTTPS, so I was wondering how that was counted.\\n- Oh, we hoped you wouldn\\'t ask that question. It\\'s by the URL. - [Audience Member 2] By the URL? - [Jessica] There might\\nbe some information that we could read. - Yeah.\\n- And we don\\'t decrypt. - [Steve Fink] So, when you\\ngo to your Slack channel, like ours, ours is RSA SOC.slack.com. - [Audience Member 2]\\nOh, so you do it through like the DNS then?\\n- Yeah, it\\'s URL.\\n- URL. - [Audience Member 2] Thank you. - [Audience Member 3] All right,\\nso the PAC file you showed personally concerns me a little bit and I was just wondering if\\nyou had any other information that you could share about that finding? - On which one?\\n- The PAC file. - [Audience Member 3] The PAC file. - [Jessica] The unsecure. (Presenters whispering) - [Steve Fink] Oh, not at this time. So, we have three sets of lawyers that we have to deal with, right? So we have RSA conference\\nlawyers, NetWitness lawyers and Cisco lawyers and then potentially\\nthat company\\'s lawyers, before we can release that name. But it\\'s now been a year. And as we\\'ve said on several\\nof these other applications, it did take us three\\nyears to get them secure. But they did talk to us, right? This particular one we\\'ve spoken to and they basically said,\\nworking as intended. - [Audience Member 3] Sorry, I\\'m confident that I know the name. I was just wondering if\\nyou could just dwell into how you came across that,\\nyou know, finding itself. - [Steve Fink] Oh, we, it leaks data like this,\\nit\\'s all in plain text. - [Jessica] It\\'s flying\\nthrough the network. What we would encourage you to do, is if you have a PAC file,\\ntake a look at it yourself. You do a little Wireshark and you can do the same thing that we did. I have colleagues that\\nhave resigned in protest, from working at that firm. - [Steve Fink] Alright, I\\nthink we\\'re out of time. - Do we have-\\n- Thank you very much for your attention. (audience clapping) - [Jessica] Thank you.', 'drive': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i9Hngf2MAvDa0gV5a5EnOqYMzsGDQ1H7'}, {'url': 'https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2024/containers%20everywhere%20advanced%20threat%20actors%20heavily%20leverage%20them', 'title': 'Containers Everywhere: Advanced Threat Actors Heavily Leverage Them', 'date': 'May 09, 2024', 'text': 'Containers are everywhere nowadays.

I have two names, one from my\\nmother and one from my father. And I'm a principal security researcher at Palo Alto Networks. I work specifically tracking\\ncloud threat actors. This presentation is\\nabout cloud threat actors, but specifically using containers for doing malicious activities. I'm assuming that everybody's\\nfamiliar with containers, and during the presentation\\nyou will see some slides with SOAR code. You don't have to\\nunderstand the SOAR code. I'm going to explain what is the idea. And regarding to containers, we are going to cover\\ndifferent aspect of that. So we are going to analyze the context where container are\\nexecuted by threat actor. We are going to analyze\\nthe different scenario where the threat actor\\nare using containers. Then we are going to display or analyze one specific campaign,\\nwhich is very interesting. That campaign is only using containers for deploying the full activity. And then we are going to look\\nat the different mistakes that threat actors are using\\nwhen they're using containers. This mistake are, because one reason. So in the past, normally, in the traditional compromise\\nchain, you have somebody that click one link, right? Click a link, you get compromise\\nfor some vulnerability, and you download one\\nbinary or group of binary. The difference with that, containers is the whole environment. It's not one binary. So you have a whole environment, like a mini operating system environment. That is very good for the\\nresearcher point of view, because the attacker make many mistakes when they try to use that full environment to deploy malicious artifacts. One of the thing that we\\nare going to look as well is we are going to talk specifically, about the PurpleUrchin campaign. I don't know if you\\nare familiar with that. And we are going to\\nanalyze, in that campaign, all the possible mistakes\\nthat the attacker made. And then finally, we will put an example of how those mistakes lead\\nto the hail locations, exact hail locations, and the name used for that threat actor. I dunno, is any Christo\\nHolloway in the audience? I don't have a face for this guy yet. I'm just phishing for a face,\\ntrying to find a face yet. And you will see, at the\\nend of the presentation, how this alias was used for one technique that we named a play and\\nrun in-cloud activity. So it's going to be very interesting. So let's go to talk\\nquickly about the context. That is the X cloud\\nmodel that we know today. And we'll see, when you move\\nfrom the left to the right, you will find how the\\ndifferent layer in the stack is being managed for somebody else. And you, as the client, as a\\ncustomer of the cloud model, you just use the layer that\\nare green, in this case. This is very important. This is very important\\nto recognize this. Why? Because the area that you don't manage is where the responsibility\\nof the security is shared between you and somebody else. And another interesting thing is sometimes you are a\\ncustomer of the company, at the company it's already run over some cloud provider, meaning that the shared\\nresponsibility is expanding to different parties. And some place you may have,\\nif you take into consideration that those part also have\\nexternal contractor, you will see that you're using a cloud service, you don't know that\\nyou have been depending on many, many, many people, that your security has to\\nbe protected by many people. So you are going to be affected\\nby that without knowing it. We are living in very interesting time, because this problem is not solvable. The problem of shared\\nresponsibility is not solved yet. In the case of container, we can see that the threat actor that we\\nare going to talk about today, it move specifically in the area. It can run containers or\\nwe can run source code. We are going to talk about containers, but the threat actor\\nthat we were monitoring, also used SOAR code. Normally it's known as a\\nserverless service that they use, will load the SOAR code and the SOAR code will run there, right? And in the case, what we are\\ngoing to see here is the way that they use containers\\nin this environment. So this is one general\\nexample of the service that the threat actor were using across different cloud providers, of different mechanisms\\nthat they were using. So in Azure he use normally create. In CleverCloud, he use\\nclever create docker. In EventNode, he use eventnode as well. So this is just an\\nexample to get one idea. But the number of\\ndifferent cloud provider, the threat actor will use? Like most at 50, around 50. Just take the most known\\ncloud provider here. And you will see interesting, like GitHub, which is not a perceived cloud provider, but it has a mechanisms\\nwhich is known as workflow to execute container. We are going to see how he\\nwas be able to use GitHub to scale the whole\\noperation that he was doing. And Heroku was another target. So we know this threat actor, because we have request from\\nHeroku at the beginning, and then we continue the search, and then we follow up\\nin that threat actor, and we uncover more and more details. This is one example of how\\ncontainers can be used today. This is pulling. This is free. You can use right now in Colab notebooks. So you can create your own container, you actually have a command shell. You can create a shell in the notebooks. And in the notebooks, you\\ncan embed your script, you can build the whole container, and you can run your container. This is very known functionality, and this is pulling one example, how do you run containers in free servers. Now container have been evolved very fast, actually it was practically\\nthe driving force for the DevOps, and it\\nmake really a good change in the mentality how we deploy software. That is why container are very important. But we have many years around, many years of container\\ndevelopment right now. And because of that, we\\nhave bad things related to container being\\naccumulated in different area. We are going to see a sample of that. So we have container scams,\\nwe will see what are the scam. We have containers everywhere. We have traces of containers,\\nmalicious container, which is still there, still\\nalive, but they exist there. And we have container with\\nbad things, usually implies that the container contain\\nmalware for example. So this example is very fun, because normally what people know is that in Docker Hub, you\\nhave malicious container. And a recent publication show that 20% of the containers in Docker Hub contain malicious binary. But this example is very funny, because this is a threat\\nactor using Docker Hub as a phishing website. So if you go right now to\\nDocker Hub, you type viagra, of course, viagra is the most known word for phishing, for a spam. You type that, you will see many accounts. This is just one example. You see many hundreds,\\nprobably thousands of accounts that use the Docker Hub website as a spam. So what you find is they have some text, they have a link. In many of them you follow the link, you get compromised with malware. In our team, we have a honeypot\\nmonitoring cloud activity. And that honeypot specifically\\ndesigned for cloud. It's very native for cloud\\nuse, only for cloud technology. And one of the thing that\\nallow that honey cloud is to execute containers, and we track how the attacker\\nare using containers, when you have a free way to\\nexecute those containers. And you will see, they get very smart. They still, I don't\\nknow if you're familiar with the concept of fileless execution, but here what you will see\\nis fileless containers, meaning that they are executing\\nthe branch in container without using a malicious container. Just use a normal container, which you see alpine is\\nthe name of the container, and run another container. But they execute, they use a command line in the entry point of the container to run, in this case, they\\nare communicating with the TNC to download for this sample. And this an example of\\nfileless entry point when you use a container\\nwith no malicious container, but do a malicious activity with that. This another example of the ransomware using interested in encrypting\\nand deleting container. I don't know why they do that, because in reality\\ncontainers are very dynamic, and you know, depend\\ntoo much in container. Now maybe the container\\nhas some mount data that is very important, and they were encrypting in\\nthis case container artifacts. Another example is the,\\nthis is very known, the crypto fight over containers, where if you are tracking\\noperation of different groups, they start deleting the container\\ncreated by another group. And this is a example where the one group, there's the case with Watchdog Group, was deleting existing\\ncontainer from another group that the other group\\nalso deployed container for doing these attributes. This is very important,\\nbecause we have cases, we have a lot of cases\\nin leaked credentials. And this is a real leaks\\nthat we can find in internet, leaking a docker-compose\\nfile with a user variable, with environment variable, having values which are very critical, which contain power, contain credential, contains information\\nabout the infrastructure of the customer. I deleted all the\\nimportant information here. This is a container malicious trails. So you can find that today in Docker. So this is a trails of a previous campaign or using malicious container\\nwith a dirty trail. There are hundreds, hundred\\nof them in Docker Hub. This is a real attack,\\nhow the threat actor that we are going to talk\\nabout in a few slide coming, was using a Google Colab\\nnotebook to execute container, just recruit to one URL,\\nthat URL has a script, and that script will create the container, and will execute the container in there. Before going forward, let's talk a little bit\\nmore about the structure of the container, how the\\ncontainers work in general. It's important to understand the mistake that the attacker did in the campaign that we are going to talk about. So normally when you have a container, what you do is you pull the\\ncontainer, pull one known image. You input another Docker file. You create a Docker container. You push the container, you\\nplay with the container, maybe you run the container, you do something on the container,\\nyou commit the container. You can commit the container,\\nmeaning that the container, if you have any change,\\nyou save the change. And then you push the change\\nof the container, change again. This is the cycle of the container. Obviously during the container lifecycle, there is many new point of artifact, of forensics artifact that you can use to track the threat actor. In the past, for example, in the past when you have\\na binary, it's very normal that threat actor modified the\\ncreation time of the binary. They play with the creation\\ntime of the binary. So you don't know when\\nthe binary was compiled, and when the binary\\nwas started to be used. The case when you are creating\\nmalicious Docker containers is even more super difficult, because there is metadata\\nassociated with the repo that you cannot change. And there is metadata\\nassociated with the container that is not easy to change, unless that you change the\\nDocker engine by itself. So this is another kind of operation that you do to container when you are working with container. You normally do a container\\nrun to run the container. If you go inside the container and do touch file, you create\\na file inside the container. And then suppose that\\nyou did that operation, then the operation three, you create a tag for the container, and you push the tag,\\nyou save the container. In this case, in the first line, that operation tag and push, it have a persistent local change. When you do the touch file,\\nyou have a change local. But when you push the container, the change to the touch file\\nis not persistent remotely. The meaning of this is, if\\nyou are a threat researcher, and you find a container\\nwhich is malicious, if you download that container to analyze, to search the container, meaning that the local persistence or the change of touch file, it was lost. But if you for some reason\\nplay with the container and you commit the container, then you have a local persistence. But when you push the container right now, then you have remote persistence. And when you have remote\\npersistence, you have the change that the threat actor\\ndid to that container. So this is very dangerous operation, that you as a malicious\\nactor, to be doing. Knowing that, we are going to talk\\nabout a couple of mistakes that the threat actor may do when they use a container, all right? I said before container\\nhas a complex artifacts, it's not a binary, it's almost practically\\noperating system that you build, a small operating system\\nthat build and you deploy it. Operating system in a way that they have a file system,\\nit have more artifacts, but it's not a binary,\\nit's a whole system inside. So we will see different mistake. We are going to see how this mistake translate in the PurpleUrchin operation. So we have entry point, we\\nhave Docker image timing, we are going to show that. Docker command history is very important. Hard-coded credentials. And the one that I just mentioned which is a pull-commit-push when you are playing this container. So right now we are going\\nto talk a little bit more about the PurpleUrchin campaign. The PurpleUrchin campaign was, so since Dig was the\\nfirst one to publish that, we were working on that already, and then we collected all the\\ndata that we already have, and then we publish with that. We were able to collect more than 300 gigabytes of\\ndata, just containers, just in form of containers, 50 gigabytes of infrastructure. We will be able to\\naccess the infrastructure of the attacker, and we\\ncollected 50 gigabyte there. We collected more than 40 crypto wallets. The attacker, the whole thing, used like 30 platform, different\\nplatform providers. He will be able to create\\n23,000 GitHub accounts and more than the 100,000 Heroku accounts. So we are going to see how he created\\nso many GitHub accounts. This is the architecture. So the architecture is very well split, but every operation, every\\npart in the architecture, is implementing with containers. So they play a run scenario. He is going to go explain there. It is a mechanism, a way that he approach, the way to use or to create containers, which are deployed then to other places. And the free acting operation is, the free acting part is\\nthe mechanisms that he used for creating account in those system. And one he created was be able to create account on those\\nsystem, automatically, he start pushing\\ncontainer to those system. And finally he managed to have\\ndifferent crypto exchange. We identify 30 crypto exchange, there's just a few on there. And he used proxy as well to, we are going to see the example\\nof how he used the proxy. So this is a statistic about the number of Docker Hub account\\nthat he created, 143, 130. So there is a bunch of GitHub\\naccount that he created and we were be able to\\nrecover 300 containers. So it's that mentioned\\nthe amount of gigabyte that 30 gigabyte that we were able to recover just in form of container. This map reveals the only, this map is not where the\\ncontainers connected with, this map is where the container\\nactually were executed. So because we were be able to\\naccess infrastructure data, from the Docker infrastructure,\\nwe were be able to map where the different containers\\nwere actually being executed. So those containers were executed in different cloud providers, in different free acting service, like GitHub who we are going to show, but we'll be able to track where those container actually run. Now we are going talk\\nabout the GitHub operation. So the GitHub operation that he implementing is very interesting, because the challenge that he has was to create as much as\\npossible GitHub accounts. For laters, with that GitHub account, what they have is, that\\nlater he have to use workflow to execute the containers automatically. And he use this mechanism,\\nthis graph, this section that you see in the left\\nside, is a container. So that section is a container. So we have basically in the\\ncontainer, he use xdotool to automate the browser, and he used one extension for two things. One thing is for implementing proxy in the extension, the browser extension. And another thing is for blocking\\nhimself from being track. That mechanisms was\\nimplemented in a container. This was the technique that he were using for bypassing the GitHub CAPTCHA. After we reported this,\\nthe CAPTCHA was changed. The mechanism was very simple. The only thing he has to do in this case, in this kind of CAPTCHA was identifying what is the spiral galaxy. And what he did with\\njust two command lines, he just converted the original image to red, green, blue. And then he calculated the\\nskewness of the red channel. And the smaller value is the galaxy. So in this case you see 0.93,\\nto this case is the second. The second one is spiral galaxy. Just with few command lines, he was be able to bypass\\nthe CAPTCHA mechanism implemented in GitHub at the\\ntime we were working with this. Using that mechanisms that you see, he was be able to be at more\\nthan 22,000 GitHub accounts. But the interesting thing is not how many accounts he could get. The interesting thing is how\\nmany execution he was be able to achieve with those account. He was be able to achieve\\nmore than 1 million, a million half container\\nexecution using workflow. This workflow, each workflow has 64 jobs. So in the same container,\\nhe created the workflow, have a template, the workflow, and then each template has 64 jobs. But how do we know that number? Because normally, you don't know what is\\nbeing executed, right? So we were be able to access the infrastructure\\nof the attacker and we map the successful executions, and we counted that with\\nthat correlated data. We access the container. We correlated the information\\nfrom the container plus the infrastructure data, it'll give you exactly that number, how many successful\\nexecution he was be able to achieve using workflow. So now let's see what kind of mistake he make in\\nthis whole operation, because he were using containers. Normally, you can find many\\nartifacts in container. We will see a couple of them. One of the most interesting one is that you have application debugging logs, you have application access logs. The access log, normally when you are\\nreviewing the access log, when you are analyzing access log, you divide the access log\\nin access by external tool, because when you open port, he have the container running, but he has to open a\\nport to monitor a panel, actually a panel that he\\nhas in each container. And when you do that, you receive a lot of automated boot access to that panel, and that access or automated\\ntool that is not important from the point of view\\nof forensics by itself. You have access by the same\\ninfrastructure operation, meaning that you have access\\ncoming from other containers which are managing the container. And the interesting one\\nthat you have access by the threat actor that he\\ndid from manual operations. At the end of the day he has a panel and he want to access the panel. If he make a mistake accessing the panel from one of the IP that he using, we will know where that's coming from. This actor specifically, he was very, I mean he has a lot of expertise\\nin developing container and developing software, but he didn't have too much\\nexpertise covering his tracks. You will see. So we found, normally containers, when you create a container, you download a initial container, you create a new container\\nfrom that container, the number of layer in\\nthe operating system, you will have a layer for any change that is made to that container. And this is reflected\\nin the operating system. So we found one container with 98 layers of file versions you can say in the file system. Even there is one fully tooled that is named Dive tool,\\nthat was very slow. We couldn't work with that tool. So we created our own tool for\\ndoing the forensic analysis of these 98 layers. This is a sample of the commit mistake. So basically, one of\\nthe thing that happen is he was creating a container\\nfrom inside a container. And the external container,\\nwhich also he working with, he commit that container as well. I don't know why he commit that container. It was a local only needed. But he committed that mistake after he made a lot of\\nchange in the infrastructure. And you will see this comment as coming from the Bash\\nhistory of the container that he were using to\\ncreate another container, which, at the same time,\\nhe committed as a container to the Docker repo. And you will see a different\\nlog example as well that was committed to the container, when the container was pushed, was already in the file system. And in the file system,\\nthat change is persistent and you will see that in the remote data. Even the database that he were\\nworking on, the operation, this is internal database that we pull out from the container, also was was there\\ncompletely accessible to us. So these container usernames, this contain username connected to wallets where the crypto wallet was\\nassigned to what exchange, to what pull was assigned\\nto be working with, a lot of data from inside. Another thing that we\\nwere interested on is to know from when this\\nattacker started to work with. And we tracked with the passive DNS data, we easily tracked to 2021 to 2023. But we noticed that two\\ncontainers were created in 2017. But what happened is those container, when you push a container to Docker repo, the tag time is not preserved, but the creation time is preserved. So if you download, you create a container from another container\\nwas created before you, that creation time is not the same than the time that he\\ncreated the container. And for that reason, this was like a false\\npositive for this year. So we couldn't identify this year. What we found later was\\nthat the Docker repo showed that that container\\nspecifically was in 2022. So it wasn't that date. This\\nentry point was in 2017. But it was that, because\\nit was a previous tag, a previous container that\\nhe was building from. But we were be able to\\nfind one certificate, and that certificate was from\\n2020, so one year back, 2020. And then we found activity,\\nwe found source code inside the container that\\nwas using all Docker API. And the Docker API expired. That Docker API wasn't in\\nservice anymore in 2019. So at the end of the day we conclude that this operation was\\nstarted in 2019 to 2023. This is another example\\nof a mistake that he made. And when you do Docker EXPOSE,\\nif you declare the port during the container creation, it's easily for you to\\nestimate to scan internet. So to look for pod that scanning internet, to look for those port or for\\nthe behavior in those port to identify pod in that container that may be running in other scenarios. This is another way to be exposed himself. Another mistake that he made, he made a lot of command\\nlines using infrastructure, I mean IP related to infrastructure, domain's name that is being used also as well in the command line. So with that, we grab a lot\\nof interesting information to track him down. Another very bad mistake that he made was hard-coded credential\\ninside the container. So a lot of configuration\\nin infrastructure, the infrastructure was big, and he used hard-coded credentials in many configuration files that were pushed to the Docker Hub inside the container by himself. When you get the container,\\nyou store the information, you get a lot of data like this one. So we were be able to find\\nhard-coded credentials. One of the interesting\\nthing that we found is in one of the committed container to the Docker repo was one access, it has a huge amount of log information, but we found one access, one panel access from one very interesting IP. And that IP was the\\nfirst one that we found to know the location of him. So if you see there is a lot of logs, but only one access. There is a panel, he created a panel in one of the container to track how the mining operation\\nwas growing over the time. We take control to the panel as well to know what he was looking at. But that access to that\\nwas a huge mistake by him. But only mistake. He made two mistake. One mistake was accessing\\nthe panel with that debris. And the second one was\\ncommitting the container to a Docker repo after he made the access, and the access go register in a container contained by itself. And then that IP usually lead us to Cape Town. And this is a mobile access clearly. So normally, if you use\\nrouting class routers, you will see that the nomenclature of\\nthe reverse DNS of the IP, it tells you what is the type of service that that IP were using at that moment. In this case it was clear that\\nwas access from the phone. This case for this id. So this panel, in this case\\nit was access from the phone. So he has all the operation running and was checking with the phone\\nhow it's going to operation. And this lead us later\\nwith further investigation, we found another interesting IP. And once we accessed the infrastructure, we were be able to identify\\nthe cell phone model that he was using during the panel access. We were be able to identify another IP, which is also, both IP,\\nthey lead you to the second. And this IP, this new\\nIP, is a computer IP. It's a service provider\\nIP, it's not a phone IP. So both, the phone IP plus the normal IP, that service provider\\nprovide you to your home, is locating the threat\\nactor in the same place. And we take a little\\nbit look more to the IP. And we found there is a torrent server in the machine he was using. So in other words in the home computer, he was using torrent as\\nwell for all that stuff. And digging pod a little bit\\nmore, we found the alias, Christo Holloway, that's\\nthe alias that he used to run the whole operation. We will see more interesting\\nstuff about that name now. So that is data about the second IP. So this is the home provider in Cape Town. This is information that\\ncorrelate to the second IP. This is a play and run indicator. So because we were be able\\nto access the infrastructure, we were be able to identify that he was creating fake accounts in different cloud providers, but he didn't pay the bill. So he just create the account,\\nplay with that he was doing, deploying infrastructure. And he then run away.\\nHe didn't pay anything. We found one account. So in the majority of the day, we didn't find how much he won, we were able to identify\\nthat he has debt of 50 euro. And because of this, we\\nwill be able to identify, I anonymized that, but we were able to\\nidentify the exact address that he'd be using correlated\\nto that fake account. And all the data collected and correlated point out exactly to that location. Later, as we continued the investigation, we found one LinkedIn account,\\nthat is named linux linux, that he correspond with the username that we use internal\\ninside the containers. And the linux linux account itself is co-located in Cape Town. He's experienced self-employed developer. During this operation, so he used different and\\nvarious crypto tactics to not be track in a way that the wall is gonna be used. One of the tactic that we\\nfound are mentioned in there, so it was a very small value\\naccount in crypto system that you do not accumulate too much money. So you don't know exactly how much money I'm doing with this operation. And another thing that\\nhe did very quickly, not only quickly, also automatically, he was exchanging in crypto change. He was changing the cryptocurrency across different crypto\\nexchange automatically, that was implemented automatically. And also we found that rapid movement of\\nbalances intra accounts in the same crypto exchange, but it moved the money from here to here, from this wallet to this wallet. Another interesting thing\\nthat he use is multiple levels of agglomeration of wallet. So you have a wallet that is very small another wallet that is very small, another wallet that is very small, and then you accumulate to another wallet, and then you accumulate a bunch of wallet, then you accumulate to another wallet. That is another mechanism that he used to mask how much he was doing. So what to do with this? So the attacker won't\\nstop using containers. We took this example to\\ngive in this presentation, because the amount of\\ndesign time he put there to create containers, and also show the mistake that they make, so you can learn from the\\nmistake that they make. But most important than that is to monitor your container living spaces, wherever you have container, know where a container\\nrunning in your company. Discover unattended containers. Sometime you left container there running. And know very well that supply chain attack\\nare difficult to adapt. But in containers, if they\\nare inside the container, they are even more difficult to adapt. And of course monitor all\\nthe container executions that you have in your company, in any of the places\\nthat you may think it, have a better, clearer view of all the containers are being run. Takeaways. Containers\\nare only present today. And threat actor use\\ncontainer in many ways. So in this case we took this example, but we have many more examples. We have actually, national state threat\\nactor using containers. This year we publish it. Activity, a campaign actually\\nusing a set of SSH proxies using forwarding, and was\\nmulti-layer forwarding proxy of SSH servers implemented with container across different cloud providers. And all the objective of that change, the only objective that\\nis to reach the victim, which at worst, already compromised. So containers are being used\\neven for national state, even when we don't see that\\ntoo much in the media yet. Containers are complex inside. It's good for researchers. And the threat actor have\\nto manage that very well. We will see, the preparation\\nthat we have here, we'll see over time,\\nmore complex architecture using containers for\\ndoing malicious activity. And well, keep happy\\nhunting for containers wherever you can find. Thank you very much. I think\\nit's time for question. (audience claps) - [Participant 1] Hi,\\nI'm new to containers. So this question may be very old. Are there steps available or methods being constructed to avoid embedded\\ncredentials in containers? - [Nelson] So the first step if you have container in your company is to have credential scanning tools, or there is a bunch of non-credentialed scanning\\ntools that you can run. And those tools support containers. So normally you point that\\ntools to container repos. So normally your containers,\\nwhen you build the container, you push that container\\nto a container repo, and then everybody use\\nthat container from there. You should be running\\ncredential detection, posting credential tools that detect in the files\\ninside the container. They go inside the container,\\nthey extract the container, pull out the container, and then look through all the\\nfiles inside the container for credentials. And that is the approach\\nthat is being followed today. So it's normally during\\nyour development cycle, you have credential scanning\\ntools all over the place. Even in your so-called repo,\\nin your container repo, all over the place in different part of the development cycle, you should have credential\\nscanning tools to identify leaks. - [Participant 1] So is there some kind of method to avoid that\\nwhat appears to me, you're saying is a bad practice? Is that a bad practice or\\ncurrently necessary practice? - [Nelson] Do you mean implementing a credential scanning tools? - [Participant 1] No, putting credentials? - [Participant 1] No, it's\\nvery bad practice in any place. Credential never has to be\\nin any files, in plain text, they are the worst practice\\nthat you can have ever. - Okay, so.\\n- And that should be identified early during\\ndevelopment process. So normally if you decide for some reason when you are developing that the credential should be in the file, that is the first time\\nyou have to spot it, because this is a bad\\ndesign from the beginning. And it's very important when you are architecturing your system to identify those bad practices\\neven from the beginning. - [Participant 1] Okay, so\\nit's not a necessary thing, which is, okay, thank you. - [Participant 2] There should\\nnever ever be credentials in your archive, in your repository. - Well, right.\\n- Ever. - [Participant 1] I couldn't quite pick up from the presentation whether\\nit was a necessary feature of containers unique\\nfrom other kinds of code. - No.\\n- And operational security. - [Participant 1] Okay. - [Participant 3] What\\nabout using Docker Scout for some type of, you know, remediation and for like static code analysis for checking things like\\nthis, is that correct? - [Nelson] Yeah, exactly, yes. - [Participant 3] Any\\nopinion on Docker Scout? - Yeah, it's okay.\\n- Okay. - [Nelson] Okay. Any other questions? Thank you.

Tim Lisko, I work at DigitalOcean, leading our security\\nengineering and IT teams on the security side, basically responsible for\\neverything left of bang, including infrastructure security and making sure that all of the product that we bring to market\\nis safe for our customers, safe for our business. And the third equity that we keep in mind is safe for the entire internet. Prior to Dio, I was in\\ncybersecurity consulting for about 10 years and I\\'ve always been in this industry. - [Yuriy] We\\'ll talk about what is it device trust\\nand why is it important, and which kind of bad problems can happen if we don\\'t establish trust in the fundamental infrastructure and all the critical devices. And Tim will walk us through what he has done at DigitalOcean, And hopefully, we\\'ll have a few points for you to adopt and\\nstart establishing trust in the equipment that\\nyou operate, with that. - [Tim] Yeah, so there\\'s an old saying, trust is earned and not given. And when we talk about trust\\nfrom a security perspective, we\\'re talking about a\\nspectrum represented here that takes us from hardware\\ndevices up through a platform that\\'s going to sling some\\nfunny means for us to laugh at. For those of you who\\nare at Monday\\'s keynote, this supply chain or this chain even goes further to the left past those firmware micro codes. We heard Antony Blinken talk about securing the raw minerals\\nto make the chips. But for us, in this room today, we\\'re gonna focus on the finished product. There\\'s many elements of\\ntrust along this train and many areas that can be\\ncompromised along the way. But we\\'re gonna concentrate\\non the far left at Microcode. If you snap a line on this image between firmware and GRUB2, everything to the right is observable in some way, shape, or form by us today. Open-source projects like the kernel, or init, new systemd, those are all developed in open source. There\\'s a huge community\\nwith a ton of eyes on them. And we can generally\\nsay, we can trust this. There\\'s vulnerabilities, but we can watch \\'em\\nget found and get fixed as commits go up. But to the left, the idea of firmware is a little bit of a blind spot for us. Vendors have proprietary firmware code. They\\'re pushed out in binaries. It\\'s not that observable to\\nmost of us as practitioners. Everything, again, is\\nobservable to the right. And excuse me, in theory, like I said,\\nit can be inspected. So with that context, we\\'ll\\ngo back to the old Axiom. Trust is earned and not given. And for us, we believe security starts with being able to have\\na trustworthy device and that provides that\\nfoundation to build upon. So how can we get to a place where we can trust this\\ndevice and verify it? And verification is what we\\'re\\ngoing to talk about today as we go through all of\\nthe different components that we have to worry about and how we start layering\\nin trust from the ground up. - [Yuriy] Thank you, Tim. So firmware, how many of us still think that firmware is something in the EPROM? This is a typical motherboard, server motherboard that we have. Well, it can be a PC. It\\'s all the same. Server motherboards are a\\nlittle bit more complex. But a server motherboard, we think it\\'s kind of a hardware, but software has it in the world. Software has it in hardware. There\\'s no hardware anymore. It\\'s all soft dish. And that server motherboard has 50 different components and chips. Some of them you can see here, you know, about a dozen here. Some of them we can recognize like the CPU and the network cards and SSDs, they all run very complex\\noperating systems inside. And a lot of software code developed by many, many suppliers. Like one of those components or some of those components, we don\\'t really recognize much, but they exist on every motherboard, on every server on a planet like this number four, BMC chip. How many of you heard about the BMC chips? Like ILO, iDRAC, sounds familiar? So those are baseboard\\nmanagement controller chips. It\\'s a motherboard. There are multiple PCs\\non top of motherboard, but this one is very interesting because the whole purpose of that chip is to provide remote data\\ncenter administrators an ability to manage servers\\nat the physical level, including power cycling, including reinstalling operating systems, remote KVM, re-imaging\\nfirmware everything remotely. That one chip by ASP, which is 70% of the market, server market. That runs full blown Linux OS with entire network stack, presentation layers, web, everything, and it fully controls, manages servers remotely and data centers. And it\\'s present on every\\nserver on the planet. So that complexity and that kind of a supply chain behind every single component is huge. That firmware in the BMC\\nchip is not developed by ASP, it developed by other\\nthird-party suppliers. And of course they\\'re using\\na ton of open-source packages to build their firmware as well. So all of those vulnerabilities, all those risks, and those open-source packages\\nand proprietary firmware and you know, Linux based firm, it\\'s all ends up in chips like that. And every device is ripe for an exploitation\\nthrough vulnerabilities and all that amounts of code. Now, how do we establish trust in the devices that we\\noperate, that we rely on, that we run our workloads on? Now we kind of solve the software security\\nproblem, right, by now, The application security. Oh, maybe not yet, but at least we have tools\\nto observe applications, see the vulnerabilities, see what they\\'re made of, components, you know, see if they\\'re\\nmalicious or suspicious or legitimate applications. We have tools to do that, you know, at the operation operating\\nsystem level and above. But we don\\'t really have any ability to interrogate software\\nrunning inside those chips, those components inside every device. We don\\'t have tools. We don\\'t have methods. They\\'re very obscure and usually manufacturers are not very open in terms of,\\nyou know, providing ability to inspect all of that software code. So how do we build trust\\nin that environment when we don\\'t have a\\nabilities to verify, right? We tend to often gravitate\\ntowards assuming trust. Believing manufacturers and every device and every component that they built, and therefore kind of\\nextending the blind trust to every manufacturers and\\ntheir entire supply chain. And I think today our processes. They\\'re good at looking at the\\nvisible state of the device, but the provenance, the\\nauthenticity, the security, and the integrity of the actual device with all of the underlying components is kind of accepted as given. So we extend the blind trust\\nto all of those manufacturers and all of those components. - [Tim] This idea of extending trust and the risk that it brings to us as an industry is absolutely nothing new. Ken Thompson wrote this quote in a paper, I think in 1984 when he\\nwon the touring ACM Award. This quote, I think is at the heart of what we want to talk\\nto you about today, which is again, instilling blind trust at the lowest level of code. Ken was worried about the C compiler, not necessarily the computers that are running our computers now. We\\'ve gone further down the stack, but this threat is still very real. And for Ken, this was especially real because he may or may not\\nhave written the backdoor into the C compiler that\\nhe hinted at in this paper. Since short paper, I think it\\'s like two or three pages, it\\'s a really wild read. Probably one of the scariest mental threat modeling papers that I\\'ve seen on the compiler code. So he wasn\\'t necessarily\\nfocused on hardware, but we are today. We have computers, running computers. W have now FPGA-based SmartNICs that have a full stack as a PCI bus attached to another computer. Layers and layers of this code\\nthat we have to introspect and understand the integrity, understand if what we got\\nfrom the manufacturers what we expected and to maintain and constantly interrogate that trust. - [Yuriy] So what do we\\nget from manufacturer? Well, I think this is a Lenovo laptop. We get an entire device from Lenovo, but that laptop or any other laptop is built by 65 suppliers. It has components in it by 65 suppliers. And those suppliers, they have subordinate\\nsuppliers around 200. And so that laptop is\\nbuilt by 300 companies across the globe in 39 countries. And that is the complexity. They introduces many\\ntypes of different risks in that supply chain that we\\ninherit by buying that laptop. And now in the next section, we\\'ll go through what sort\\nof problems can happen. Now some of the problems\\nare pretty obvious, like we can get a counterfeit equipment. It happens a lot more often\\nthan we think even now. A week ago, someone was indicted\\nfor six and a half years because of running 19 companies selling counterfeit Cisco equipment worth of almost billion dollars. And that equipment ended\\nup in a lot of customers, including in the DOD, including the Air force and the network supporting\\nmodern aircraft. So that dude messed\\nwith the wrong customer. That\\'s why he got caught. But how many organizations are still using the counterfeit\\nequipment from Cisco or counterfeit chips in other equipment? Now counterfeiting, well,\\nit\\'s obviously malicious, but it\\'s not intended to\\ncompromise an organization. But when you are using\\ncounterfeit equipment, all kinds of problems can happen. Including, you know, if the components are\\nused or cheap components where the code knockoff code, then the reliability is not there. And potentially vulnerabilities are there that can be used to\\nexploit an organization. But inherently, it\\'s not in order to compromise organizations. But there are other\\nproblems in the supply chain that we inherit by buying all\\nof that amounts of equipment. And those are vulnerabilities because we can get components\\nin those devices running code with ton of vulnerabilities. And without any visibility to look for those vulnerabilities, we don\\'t know how to address them, how to patch them, you know, how to even compensate\\nfor those vulnerabilities. So vulnerabilities like\\nspeculative execution or transient execution, there\\nare probably three dozen that were discovered in major CPUs. We all use them. The blast radios of those\\nvulnerabilities is significant because those CPUs are in every\\ndevice or vulnerabilities. The gigabytes like the back door shipped with 400 motherboards by gigabytes or the vulnerabilities like in that chip that I\\nmentioned a minute ago, the baseboard management controller chip, those are remote\\nvulnerabilities in Linux code. Some of the examples are the\\nBMC and C vulnerabilities that eclipsing team has discovered in a MegaRAC BMCs that are used by 12 to 15 different server manufacturers or other vulnerabilities, because that code is both proprietary and people tend to introduce\\nvulnerabilities in any code. But also that code uses a\\nlot of open-source packages, which is Tim\\'s favorite topic to discuss, - [Tim] Again, the code that\\nis running these machines, the BMCs, it\\'s a full stack Linux. At some point, that manufacturer has produced a version that they\\'re gonna burn into\\nthe chip and ship to us. There are occasionally updates, but they aren\\'t long lived updates. Supportability for some of\\nthese platforms might end as soon as the device ships out. Maybe you get a few years\\nof updates coming after it. But whatever got stamped onto that chip, might have a Log4j issue lingering that\\'s never going to get an update. You use a BMC, you often have a presentation\\nlayer as Yuriy mentioned, you might get a little Java-based popup to actually console into a machine. Could have Log4j something that just came out very recently, might have had a vulnerable version of xz and that existential crisis\\nthat we all just lived through for a few days constantly\\nembedded in this. And again, not having a\\nvery frequent update cycle. So how do we find these vulnerabilities? How do we keep discovering these things and get to a safe place or at least put compensating\\ncontrols to help us not be exploited from one\\nof those vulnerabilities? - [Yuriy] So when we talk about the open-source vulnerabilities, we often tend to think about, you know, the applications that are\\nused in open-source packages. But you know, speaking of Log4J, network appliances by\\nmultiple manufacturers, they\\'ve been using Log4J and had Log4Shell there. How do we know that? How do we know that, you know, z backdoor doesn\\'t end up in the Linu inside BMC chips? I think that\\'s a very complex problem that we\\'re trying to,\\nyou know, build trust in other type of problems\\nin the supply chain. - [Tim] So as we are going through and we\\'re going to just kind\\nof enumerate a few examples, but not just attacking open\\nsource or things like that. We have attackers going\\nafter these companies because they realize the value of being able to compromise\\nat a firmware level, from a persistence perspective. Two examples that we have here are the Intel UEFI\\nsource code being leaked, which would be an incredible\\nvaluable tool for hunters to start going through, looking at the code and trying\\nto find new vulnerabilities that they can exploit to write exploits, to maintain persistence. We also had to had hackers hit MSI and get their code signing keys, meaning anything that they could push out would be accepted because\\nit could be signed. And many of those MSI devices far outta support that key is there. If you\\'re still running perhaps maybe a 10-year-old MSI laptop, you may still have a vulnerable key that is going to accept sign code. So hackers are constantly\\nlooking at manufacturers and at this underlying code, understanding new ways into a system. - [Yuriy] I got it. So we looked at counterfeit equipment, we looked at vulnerabilities. Those represent risks. vulnerabilities can be exploited. And sometimes manufacturers\\nget compromised, like the MSI case or others. Now that\\'s a perfect combination to start developing exploits, to start developing implants into the equipment that\\nis live operational. And that\\'s what we see\\nfolks started doing. A couple of examples here. One is the BlackLotus implant. BlackLotus is exploiting a vulnerability and a UEFI boot loaders\\nthat bypasses secure boot. Why is it notorious? And you probably have seen some alerts and guidelines from CISA from the NSA about the BlackLotus. The interesting part here is that a threat actors combines the complexity of the UEFI\\nsupply chain ecosystem combines the prior knowledge\\nof bypasses of secure boot that were published in\\n2013 for the first time. And 10 years later, they used because the world\\nmoved to the UEFI finally and started adopting the\\nsecure boot in 2020s. And they now started using\\nthose vulnerabilities and that ecosystem and that UEFI component to develop a full weaponized implant bypass secure bit on\\nmost of the PC systems. And other folks like Glupteba back door started using those components as well. So that is starting to happen by both the threat actors\\nlike ransomware groups exploiting vulnerability,\\nvulnerable network appliances on the network edge like Citrix, you know, log bid heading, Citrix appliances through Citrix bleed, and so on and so forth. But so the PCs and servers,\\nthey\\'re not unique. Those problems persist through any type of\\nequipment that we\\'re using. Another good example here is APT28 was exploiting Cisco appliances. And if you remember the\\nJaguar Tooth malware, they were exploiting\\nvulnerability in SNMP parsing of Cisco iOS firmware because SNMP object identifiers\\nwere encoded in ASN1. Now we all know that as ASN1\\nparsing is perfectly safe and perfectly simple. If you are interested in looking at what vulnerabilities\\nexist in ASN1 parsing and specifically object identifiers, there are a few presentations there. I also did a talk on that specific topic. But we see that Russian\\nthreat actors here, the Fancy Bear, they\\'ve been exploiting\\nthose vulnerabilities in the vulnerable firmware\\ncode of network appliances. Not just MPCs, not just in servers. So, now switching to Tim. - [Tim] So I think one of the things that we wanted to establish\\na little bit of context and history of how Yuriy\\nand I got to this stage to talk to you today and we\\'ll bring a little bit\\nof practical implementation of where this approach of device trust actually hits the ground. So before diving into this, again, just a little bit more context and to bring you all into the story, Dio was founded 12 years ago and our mission is to\\nsimplify cloud computing. That mission statement\\nkind of infuses everything that we do in our approach to problem solving within DigitalOcean. Oops, there we go. Nope, that shouldn\\'t be there. So, well I didn\\'t realize\\nI was still in there. Sorry about that, anyway. So Dio has, over the years, grown both organically and inorganically. I\\'m gonna focus the rest of\\nthis case study on integration. So on inorganic growth. Generally, for those of you who have been part of an integration, when you have to bring\\nin that other company into your trusted environment, there\\'s a few options for\\nways that you can do this. When it comes to, and\\nthe focus is going to be on endpoints generally one\\nof the easiest options. You buy all new laptops, you lay down your trusted environment, your Windows build, your macOS build, your management stack in tune,\\nJamf, whatever it may be. And your security stack. You give those new\\ndevices and the old ones, maybe they get donated, maybe they\\'re given to the employees or maybe they\\'re sent to e-waste, highly trusted way of\\nintegrating new employees into your environment. Comes with a couple cons. High cost potential for a lot of e-waste, but it\\'s pretty frictionless. You have a well trotted path\\nto get those devices out to your new employees or the\\nacquired employees coming in. One of the other options\\nthat you might have is as is adoption. If during due diligence you come to an understanding\\nthat your management stack and the acquired\\ncompany\\'s management stack is fairly compatible, maybe you can just bring those devices over into your environment. But that takes a lot of trust and a lot of trust through due diligence, which generally you don\\'t\\nhave that much time to do in a constrained integration. But bring some pros, a lot lower cost. You\\'re not contributing to e-waste. You don\\'t have to worry about donations. But again, you have to put a\\nlot of faith in your ability to find trust during due diligence. So I position those two as pretty much your two standard avenues for asset integration when it comes to acquire\\nor integrating a company. What if those options\\naren\\'t available to you? What if you\\'re acquiring a\\ncompany in a part of the world where supply chains are\\nincredibly difficult? You can\\'t get new devices to where this company is employee base is or getting them there comes\\nwith an incredible expense. Shipping import tariffs where\\nyou take maybe a $2,000 device and suddenly you\\'re looking\\nat about 7,500 per device to get into a country to get those replace option endpoints into your new employee\\'s hands. This was the challenge\\nthat we were presented with one of our acquisitions. Figuring out a way that wouldn\\'t bring like a\\nmillion dollar extra cost to the integration for us. Yuriy and I and eclipsing had met when we were focused on establishing trust in a server environment and it presented a\\nreally interesting idea. Could we push this agent out to all of the existing devices\\non the acquired company that we were looking at and understand if we\\ncould trust those devices that were already in the\\nhands of the employees? Could we bring that trust up? And then if we knew\\nthat the device was okay and trustworthy, we can start a little bit of factory model to re-image them, lay down our management plane and bring them into a\\ntruly trusted environment. And we found out yes, we could. And it came with a lot of pros. Mostly low cost, no e-waste, no donation process that we had to manage. And we are able to see\\neach of those devices what vulnerabilities existed. And if there were any integrity issues. Thankfully we had two. We were able to pull those devices out and the kind of the approach that we took proved itself\\nout, which was fantastic. Now there is some high user friction here and it is a decently unique\\nuse case for an integration, but it enabled us to move faster and not incur an additional, you know, million dollar integration cost. So the program that we built and how we kind of stopped\\nworrying about this and learned to trust is gonna get broken down\\ninto three big pillars. Establishing a hardware\\ntrust by using a solution that will give you visibility into that. I am here with Yuriy, and we did a vendor scan around this. There are some other vendors there. Find one that\\'s going to work for you and figure that out if you ever\\nhave to go down this route. After you establish that trust and you see a clear signal that you can trust these devices, we had to then build our operating level or operating system level trust. Laying down our management plane, laying down our security plane, et cetera. The great thing with some of\\nthis agent based approach now, as Yuriy mentioned earlier, we not solved security at\\nthe operating system layer, any application layer, but we do have a lot of visibility. We have a ton of tools out there that can provide us an indication that something is breaking down in trust at the operating system level\\nor the application layer. Now we also have an ability to continually monitor platform\\ntrust on these devices, especially in potentially\\nhigh risk geographies. If you have executives who travel often, it\\'s also an amazing way\\nof continually monitoring. Has anybody messed with the\\nhardware of this device? So now we have trust maintained\\nat the hardware level, the operating system level and up. So establishing hardware trust, just digging into the\\ndetails a little bit more. As part of this acquisition, not only did we not have\\nfirst party supply chains, we also had a hodgepodge of vendors. This was a scrappy startup. We weren\\'t necessarily\\nfocused on IT resiliency or you know, a strong mature IT processes. They got devices into\\ntheir developer\\'s hands so those developers could build. We had Lenovo, Apple, MSI, and a whole bunch of\\nother vendors in there. And again, this was in a part of the world where we had to take a\\nvery strong risk lens and understanding were\\nthose components authentic, had they been messed with, was there anything already there that we had to worry about? So as we were going through\\nthe thinking of this and the solution, option one, we could bring\\neach one of these devices into an IT shop and have\\nsome poor IT analyst go to the manufacturer\\'s website, download the latest firmware, and re-flash the device in hopes that it would catch\\nanything that might be there that seemed incredibly intensive\\nfrom a toil perspective and each device was going\\nto be bespoke research to get that done; option two is a software agent solution that could provide us this visibility and give us an indication of how trustworthy this device would be. Obviously we\\'re here. We went with option two. I mentioned earlier, after establishing that\\ntrust in the device, we built a factory model for\\nre-imaging these devices. We still had a user have\\nto come into the office, they surrendered the device\\nfor four or five hours, we rebuilt the operating system and put our management stack on it. But we really focused on making this a easy process for those employees. Give them learners. Don\\'t impact any productivity. Don\\'t impact the business,\\nbut establish that trust. And then I mentioned earlier, this continuous monitoring. We can now look at and understand, do we have any threats in the environment? And by threats, you know, we\\'re really focusing on integrity issues. Has anything touched this firmware where we\\'re going to have an indicator that something bad may have happened and we also have an insane\\namount of visibility into the existing\\nvulnerabilities on those devices and we can drive our IT shop to go make sure that we\\ncan push out new firmware, new bios updates to minimize some of those\\nexisting vulnerabilities. So that is a quick study of how we establish device\\ntrust at DigitalOcean and we\\'re able to kind of overcome a very interesting challenge\\nin an IT integration. And I think for those of you who are here interested in this, it presents a really\\ninteresting viable option for any of your future integrations. If you don\\'t want to have\\na huge capital outlay to give new devices to\\nan acquired company, this is an approach\\nthat you might consider as things are moving\\nforward in an integration to keep those devices\\nin the employee\\'s hands, establish trust within the\\nareas that you care about and move forward very quickly. - [Yuriy] All right, awesome. Thank you, Tim.\\n- Yep. - [Yuriy] It was a fantastic case and a fun to collaborate and work on. - [Tim] Absolutely. - [Yuriy] Now we can live with extending blind trust to manufacturers. I don\\'t think it\\'s the\\nfuture that we want to be in because this is so foundational. All of the applications,\\nall of the workloads, all the data is processed\\non the infrastructure. And if we can\\'t trust that infrastructure or we blindly trust that infrastructure, then I think a lot of\\nthings happen as a result. So how we can improve generally in that sense to start really building, building up trust in the\\ninfrastructure and the devices? I think CISA has been doing a great job and the NSA more recently\\nhas been doing great job, really telling us about the problem. Alerting what sort of\\na supply chain problems and gaps happen, including\\nmajor vulnerabilities or maybe major exploitation campaigns, like the BlackLotus here or publishing guidelines\\non how to mitigate those, like improving the security of the baseboard management controllers. And even more recently, how to even build the programs like the trust in the devices as part of zero trust architecture. But I won\\'t make you read all those alerts and announcements. There are too many of them. And I think they\\'re all great. But when I break down\\nwhat needs to be done into kind of a major buckets, then one is we have to start\\ncomparing manufacturers. And factor in security\\nand supply chain risk of the manufacturers, of the\\ndevices that they produce, the versions, the models that they have, the components they use so that we don\\'t end up in a situation where we have an counterfeit\\nor maybe a low quality equipment from manufacturers or suppliers. I use this example with fake coke. We probably don\\'t want to\\ndrink fake coke to begin with. So why would we use a subpar equipment in such a critical environments, like our infrastructure. But even if we like real coke, sometimes we don\\'t necessarily want certain components in it like the high fructose corn syrup. So I think in order to achieve similar with equipment and we have to extend similar verification to our critical equipments. In order to achieve that, we need to understand which components are\\nused in those devices. We need to understand what\\'s in there and what code is in there, and therefore which risks exist. There maybe vulnerabilities, maybe a very old packages or maybe some other problems, like in this case, Logs4J. If it ends up in one of our servers or network appliances, we wanna know that. And I think this is where the SBOM, the bill of material software, bill of materials help or the HBOM or the FBOM, the firmware\\nbill of materials. I think that\\'s where they help. And we can start mapping\\nthose two vulnerabilities and we can start thinking\\nabout how to address them. And finally, it may be a perfect device that we want to use and operate in our infrastructure, but we need to understand if it has been tampered with by someone. We need to understand that it doesn\\'t have any\\nworm like that inside it or some kind of a persistent\\nmodule in of the chips or one of the firmware software\\nrunning in that device. And do that not just once, but extend that continuously because threat actors are\\nexploiting vulnerabilities and those devices then implant\\nthem while we operate them. So to summarize, I think the\\nthree buckets are important as understanding what our\\nproducts, external products, like those devices are made of. Those components, who produces them, where they were produced, what code is running there, and then map those\\ncomponents to vulnerabilities to security problems that suppliers might have introduced\\ninto those components and the code running there. So leveraging all kinds\\nof bill of materials and then mapping to vulnerabilities and scanning all those\\ncomponents for vulnerabilities. And finally, having some way to verify that the code running in each component of every piece of equipment\\nthat we operate is authentic, hasn\\'t been tempered with,\\nhasn\\'t been modified, does not include any sort of bag doors that might have intro\\nbeen introduced somewhere in the supply chain or\\npersistent implants. So I think with those three, and by the way, I\\'m\\nlisting some of the NIST 1800 reference architectures relevance to each of those components. Because NIST and National\\nCybersecurity Center of Excellence created reference design\\nand reference architecture on how to address some of\\nthese for offline reading. - [Tim] So trying to get to a place where you can walk out of here with a little bit of an application and maybe a little bit of a plan of how you could research\\nthis in your own environments. This is not something that I\\nthink needs to be everywhere. This idea of the consistent\\nmonitoring of device trust. You have to take a\\nrisk-based approach to this. Where are the areas in your\\nbusiness, in your organization where you have to have an\\nextreme amount of trust and be able to verify it? In an ideal world, yes, we\\ncould do this everywhere. But in an ideal world or in a real world, we have constraints that\\nwe have to work through. So look at your area and understand what are the things that\\nI truly need to protect. Maybe it\\'s could just be, you know, if you have executives traveling the globe focusing this on their\\nendpoints as an example. If you have a strong trusted\\ncomputing environment focusing in on those servers in there. But again, those circumstances are unique to your own organization. Yuriy referenced some of the guidance. There is fantastic reading out there that can help kind of\\ndevelop the risk thinking around supply chain risk management. NIST 2.0, or excuse me, CSF\\n2.0 has some great controls and ways of thinking about the risk management of supply chain. In three months from now, if you figured out that you do\\nhave an application for this, prioritize and scope\\none of those projects. Go out and do a vendor scan and figure out who\\'s going to\\nbe the best partner for you. I come from an organization where we love building tools in-house. The engineering culture at\\nDio is absolutely amazing. Our hardware engineers\\nare focused on making sure that our product is incredibly stable and safe for our customers. For me, it does not make sense to try to have those engineers focus on establishing trust of our devices. There\\'s that whole axiom\\nof buying versus building. There are experts out there who do this vulnerability research, this hardware research daily. For me, looking at this, this does not make sense\\nfor me to build this. just like it doesn\\'t\\nnecessarily make sense for me to build an\\nentire internal identity and access management program when I might also be able\\nto go to a vendor partner to help give me that software. So understand where you might need this, figure out what vendors are\\ngoing to be right for you and your use cases, and start having a discussion around building this into\\nyour security program to gain a little bit more visibility and a lot more trust\\ninto your environment. And as you move further to the right start operationalizing this. If you get alerts popping\\nout of one of these tools, that is an excellent security\\noperation center use case. What happens if we detect that there is a integrity\\nproblem in one of our devices? What\\'s the operation\\nfor pulling that thing from your environment to\\nreally go investigate it? And from there, once you get this going, you are going to have a lot\\nmore trust and assurance in the hardware in your environment. And again, you have that confidence of building something on a\\nvery solid foundation up stack. Anything to add? - [Yuriy] Thank you, Tim. And with that, we\\'re concluding the presentational part of the talk and we have a few minutes for Q&A. - [Audience 1] How did\\nit cost you to, you said it was about a million dollars, you probably had 50 devices that you needed to deal\\nwith in that acquisition, what did it end up costing you when you (indistinct)? - [Moderator] The microphone. - [Tim] So the question\\nwas how much did it cost us when we had a balance of scales between paying a million dollars for brand new devices or going down this route\\nfor software, you know, without disclosing actual software costs and all that fun stuff? Substantially less by a\\nmassive order of magnitude. Convincing the company to say, \"Please give me a little\\nbit of a budget unlock to buy these software licenses was substantially less painful when put next to a million\\ndollar bill there.\" But it was far less expensive than that. - [Tim] A small fraction. You know, when ripping and replacing a networking equipment by\\nsome, you know, manufacturer for $3 billion, that\\'s\\nprobably much less than that. Yes? - [Audience 2] Hello, my question goes as far as you talked about a motherboard is made up of about more\\nthan 300 competitors coming up to make up a laptop. Now looking at those\\nfigures of more than 300 to start with, do they trust themselves? Do they trust the products? Do they consider the risk facts factor for each of the components\\nthey were designing, analyzed, brought forth so much that they can integrate them into a comprehensive\\nanalysis to know exactly how can we analyze the vulnerabilities we may be bringing on to the laptop? However, from other spectrum, we all tend to look at\\nthe laptop is trustable. We can trust it. Our devices are trust it. How do we, on our own part,\\ntrust what is not trustable? That\\'s my question. - [Yuriy] Do you want me to take question? - [Tim] Yeah, ahead, I\\'ll jump in. - [Yuriy] Thank you for the question. So I think, and we want to\\ntrust our suppliers, absolutely. We want to trust manufacturers of systems that we buy and operate, but they have such a complex\\nsupply chain behind them. They have so many third-party,\\nfifth-party suppliers that make up those devices that it almost becomes impossible without a technological way to ensure that every one of those suppliers, no matter where they are and what their security maturity is, they do the right things. So there is absolutely no assurance that all of those suppliers have done any kind of verification for vulnerabilities at this point today. So we need technological\\nmethods to do that and to inspect those components\\nthat make up devices. In order for us not to really, you know, trust that everyone is\\ndoing the right things, but verify that trust. - [Audience 3] Okay, I found\\nthe microphone this time. So two-part question. When looking for a software vendor to do this kind of scanning\\nto evaluate the devices, not the Gartner kind of point of view, but what are some real key insights of what to look for in a vendor? What are some insights that not having been there\\nbefore and done that, you wouldn\\'t necessarily know or key things to look out for that are gonna be really\\nvaluable in return? - [Tim] I can share a couple\\nthings and then please jump in. One of the things that I looked for when we were going down this route was the original research coming out some of these companies. Was it just a software company that was consuming someone else\\'s research or were they publishing their own and kind of demonstrating\\ntheir technical expertise because of that research? That was one criteria. The other was deployment models for how we could get this out and then, you know, standard\\nthings like pricing. And that that level of partnership and trust that you can have with a vendor. A little bit of the intangibles. But for me, and this is just for me, the original research\\nwas a huge differentiator when I was looking at vendors. - [Audience 3] Thank you,\\nwas there anything key in the what it could scan and the kind of results\\nthat it would return that was insight that you valued after having went through the process? - [Tim] Yes, so looking at,\\nhave you ever read change logs for firmware updates - [Audience 3] Sure. - And how terse they are?\\n- Yeah. - [Tim] They\\'re like, we fixed\\na security issue, which one? Maybe there\\'s a CBE reference\\nthat goes along with it. But there were very few tools that could look at the state\\nof your machine right now and give you a snapshot of\\nwhere are the vulnerabilities that I have as confirmed by the code. Not necessarily just a press\\nrelease, not a press release, a change log release or an update. Also, the industry has gotten better, like Lenovo has their vantage that will do system updates automatically. And I think Apple also has\\na great update mechanism. But when you\\'re running massive servers, that is completely a pull to understand when that is going to happen and how and when you have\\nto take downtime for that. Having a tool that can interrogate those things on demand makes it a little bit\\nless of a pull obligation on the staff. And you can have that\\ninformation pushed to you say, oh, something has changed. The software has detected a change that I need to be aware of\\nand I can go sprint at that. - Thank you.\\n- Yeah, anything to add? - [Yuriy] Would love to, yes. Thank you, Tim. I think a couple of things. So one is because the\\ndevices are so complex, you can\\'t really assess the entire device with any software tool. And over time, hopefully the tools we have we built will mature and the coverage will increase. You have to look at a,\\nyou know, which components are actually being assessed to what level. Like checking a version of the bias has absolutely zero impact on really establishing trust that the bias is actually okay. You have to see if the\\nbias is actually extracted, and I\\'m using bias term as loosely because nobody is using bias anymore other than maybe in\\ncritical infrastructure and other critical environments. But the world moved to the UEFI, which is the operating system on its own. So it needs to be extracted. It needs to be analyzed. Not just, you know, checking the versions of these components. And how many of these components are actually verified and to what level? Because threat actors aren\\'t targeting every component today. They\\'re targeting specific things. And that intelligence also needs to be kind of accounted for in, you know, how the tools analyze those devices. And the second point is the data. This is, I probably said\\ncomplex ecosystem too many times during this talk, but it is. Because if you take HP Pavilion 550, it has 4,668 configurations. Just one model. How do we even account for\\nall of those configurations of each device versions and how do we map them to vulnerabilities that are almost never end up in NVD? Because those are hardware\\nmanufacturers, device suppliers, they best case they publish advisories. But that\\'s the best case. Not everyone does at all or\\neven patch vulnerabilities or even look for the\\nvulnerabilities in their components. So you know, how the\\ntools collect that data about every manufacturer, every supplier and their risks, vulnerabilities,\\nprofiles, versions, and so on and so forth. I think that that data is important. - Thank you.\\n- Thank you for the question. Well, we have one minute left. Any last questions? Okay, thank you all. It\\'s a pleasure to be here. Thanks for hosting us. - [Tim] Thank you.

Thanks for spending the time\\nhere to listen to talk on SBOM. I am Manoj. I am managing security and engineering at a, an\\nML startup called Predigle. So I\\'ve been in this\\nspace, I, I\\'m in this space for about last three years\\nnow since executive order on, in like using SBOMs to give transparency into supply chain software supply chain. So again, before we go into\\ndisclaimer, it\\'s my opinion, all the, all the talks, it\\'s not, so just make sure you research before, before you do any of the\\naction items I propose. So one, the one thing after coming into RSA as\\nas a security personnel and an assurance governance and assurance personal is\\nthat one was reassuring, one that like, like me, other professionals are\\nworried about liability, worried about software supply chain, and also worried about how AI is going to impact our software\\nsupply chain, right? So my thought here is\\nto kind of break it down and kind of provide a mental model of how to think about software supply chain and providing transparency\\ninto software supply chain. And do you need to provide\\nsoftware supply chains, transparency to our customers? What are the trends which\\nare in the industry, which is actually pushing\\nyou towards giving you more transparency? Is is the, I\\'m, I\\'m trying to\\nshed some more lights there, so that you see that, that that trend is moving towards\\nmore transparency into the software supply chain at the same time, more transparency into\\nthe data provenance. That\\'s it. We, we all understand how our SDLC works. If you are a software shop,\\nit\\'s a mix of our SDLC controls. As a governance team, we\\nput out some controls. So the software team follows certain SDLC. Follows the SDLC principles\\nthey use in like the third party dependencies and build,\\nbuild out a software, right? And to provide transparency, there needs to be incentives. So it is essentially,\\nfor me, legal compliance. That\\'s, that\\'s one of the,\\none of the big incentives for us to provide transparency. In order to provide\\ntransparency, there needs to be standards on how to comply with it and who are, who are the parties,\\nwho are, who are impacted by it, and the tools you\\nneed to use to generate or provide transparency, right? All right. Gimme a second. All right. So if I, if, if I can kind of summarize the trends\\nwe have seen in the, in providing software supply\\nchain transparency so far, the, the first thing we do in,\\nin providing transparency is to, is to provide accountability. So how do you, how do you, how do you provide transparency\\nand accountability? We provide like the, the\\nterms of use, the license and the privacy statements. The terms of use is the\\nrights you give to the user. And the license is kind of\\nthe accountability on the, on the software provider\\nin saying, okay, this is, this is what you get into. And the privacy statement\\nis the data rights you are providing to the customer. And based on those terms of use license and privacy statements,\\nyou, you are on the hook for providing vulnerabilities or patches. And in order to, for the\\ncustomer to trust you, you provide transparency on the trust and the way you provide trust. The transparency on\\ntrust is certifications. We go through SOC\\ncertifications, high trust and multiple ISO and certifications to provide\\ntransparency on transparency to the customers and saying, \"Hey, you can trust the software we\\nprovide and start using it.\" That is, that I would say\\nis the current version of providing transparency. And what I\\'m hearing more and more is that, that that form of transparency is not enough. The customers are demanding more and the governments are demanding more. So what, what do I, what, what I see is that more the trend towards attacking the software\\nsupply chain to exploit, and the, one of the keynotes\\nkeynote speaker refer, referred to that as, as a new trend, which is 40% of our attacks are now through\\nexploits on the software. No more social engineering. So what it, what it means is\\nthat there\\'s an increased trend or reduced cost for an attacker to go through our supply chain and attack our supply chain,\\nthen social engineer us, right? So what it means is that the, the amount of transparency we provide on\\nour software today is just not enough for the customers,\\nfor our customers to secure their software. At the same time, for us to\\nsecure our, our infrastructure, the current form of\\ntransparency is not enough. So in the current form of transparency, there\\'s no regulations. There\\'s like the, there\\'s the,\\nthe, the transparency is, is is regulated by the individuals. As a software provider, I decide\\nwhether I want to provide, provide our customer with what\\nI\\'m doing in our, in my SDLC or fine train details into, into my SDLC. I do provide my customers into\\na, a definition of what I do, but I don\\'t provide a standard\\nway of saying, okay, I\\'m, I\\'m, I\\'m broke. Like essentially my whole SDLC\\nreturn in a standard format. So there\\'s no standards for it. So again, we do have tools and, and stakeholders doing the same thing, but in, in, in, in the, in, in, in terms of like the framework,\\nthe way we, we, we had to think about the\\nexisting transparency is how do you assign accountability? How do you assign trust and how do you assign liability, right? So the accountability is, is\\nassigned through the terms of use license and privacy policy. Trust is assigned through\\neither certification. So if you are in special devices or critical infrastructure,\\nyou are, you are, you are certified by a, a government body and the liability is\\nessentially private, right? This is, this is the existing\\nform of accountability, trust, and liability and how the\\ntransparency works today and how the industry is or the industry is moving towards 2.0 where there is more legal framework on how you should establish\\nthat transparency, right? There, there is a requirement\\nfrom, from a legal, legal side or from the regulation side to provide SBOM, provide a visual for every customer of your product into the ingredients which go into your product. When I mean ingredients, I\\'m meaning the libraries which you use or the build are also\\nthe, the processes you use to build the product, right? So what do I mean by 2.0 is essentially\\ncodifying all these artifacts, including your licenses,\\nincluding your ingredients, and including your dependencies\\ninto the SBOM, right? And also giving full transparency into what are the vulnerabilities\\ncoming along with it so that you can, what it enables you is, what it enables you is to, is\\nto quantify your risk, right? So once you know the ingredients\\nof the, of the software and, and the vulnerabilities\\nassociated with the software, you are essentially giving\\na means for the customer to quantify risk, right? And what the, the accountability, trust and liability matrix doesn\\'t change, but the liability in the one\\nthing which I want to, I want to highlight is that the liability is\\nbeing codified today in the legal framework. It\\'s moving from the private\\nindividual contracts into a legal framework where our\\ngovernments are providing a legal framework on how to assign\\nliability to a software, right? And this, the, the transparency\\nframework is allowing them to say that through the\\nSBOM, through the virtual like vulnerability exchange formats, you can actually quantify\\nwhat a vulnerability you are or what is the risk you\\'re taking and what is the, what is the remediation or the SLA you are getting into. If we can achieve 2.0, there\\'s\\nmore we can do with SBOM and VEX, that\\'s what I call 3.0. So, so the, the software dependencies we don\\'t really need to adhere to just tracking software dependencies. Today through AI, there is an\\nexplosion of interest in AI. It also means there\\'s an\\nexplosion of, in explosion of tax surface as a governance and a security assurance person, it actually creates more problems for us. So what it also means is that\\nthe, the problem, there\\'s a, there\\'s a interest in tracking what those, what those new attack surfaces are. And SBOM\\'s and what, like essentially\\nVEX formats can help us track those attack surfaces, essentially give us a better inventory of those attack surfaces. What do I mean by that? So we can codify our infrastructure, we can codify our data infrastructure. By doing that, we are\\nable to have a inventory of our data infrastructure,\\nwhich is going into our AI software, which, which is,\\nwhich is what is the future. So once we have the codified\\nformat of data infrastructure, the software infrastructure and our software itself, we can then scale the way\\nwe establish controls. Today the controls we establish\\nare pretty manual in nature. So what by codifying our,\\nour, our, our artifacts, the artifacts we generate,\\nthe artifacts we consume, the, the data we consume, we are, we can push the control execution or control implementation into, we can automate the\\ncontrol implementation. So that said, what is\\nincentivizing this, this trend, what is inside advising\\nmoving towards an SBOMB, like why do we need to do SBOM? Essentially the regulations, there was an executive order in 21 in May from our, from the, from the\\nus US executive branch to, to provide SBOMs and the vulnerability\\ninformation for a software whenever you are dealing with\\nfederal government, right? So that is, that is a\\ntrend in, in United States. There is the, after, after the 2121 executive\\norder, there came a FD and medical devices act on\\nin 22, which required SBOM and vulnerability exchange. In addition to that, you\\'ll\\nalso have to track end of life information with end of life information for\\nthe software you provide on medical devices. So what what, what I\\'m\\ntrying to say here is that there is regulations\\npushing our, pushing us as software providers to\\nprovide more transparency into what ingredients we, we\\nare giving in the software. What are the vulnerabilities\\nwhich are associated with it, and what is the life cycle of that software if it is going\\ninto a critical infrastructure, in this case, medical devices and, and if you are supplying for\\nthe critical infrastructure in, in which is department defense\\nor the homeland security or department manage, right? So any, any of the federal government if you\\'re handling them, so you need to have SBOM in place and be able to provide some form of vulnerability management,\\nwhich is already there. It\\'s just that how do you\\nprovide in a transparent and a standard manner, right? With that, I also want to\\nkind of say that what is, what is increasingly\\nalso becoming a trend is that our digital infrastructure\\nis being considered as, as critical as a physical infrastructure. So what do I mean by that? Our digital infrastructure, our software, the SaaS platforms which\\nenable the, enable the commerce in this country is\\nalso being treated more like the roads and the, and, and the utilities, which\\nenable everyday comfort for us, right? So the, it\\'s, it\\'s as important, the digital infrastructure\\nis as important for, for the country as the\\nphysical infrastructure, right? So to kind of reinforce that,\\nEU is also following up. So Germany had its own way\\nof providing transparency to the software, which was\\nthe German IT security act. Finland had its own, and\\nafter that, US has come along and created a cyber resiliency\\nact and essentially forcing or enforcing the, the idea that we need to provide transparency. When you create a software product and or, or an IOT product, you need\\nto be able to say what, what is the ingredients of your product? What is the vulnerability which\\nI\\'m, which I\\'m coming with? And that, and also give an idea\\nof what is the lifecycle of the product, right? Australia is also doing\\nit in the, in the period between I submitted the talk and now Singapore has, has started talking about transparency in\\nthe cyber resiliency, right? So cyber resiliency is, is, is, is a common theme across\\nall the governments and digital infrastructure\\nbeing as critical as physical infrastructure\\nis also another common theme. And how do they start\\nproviding it is by starting to push transparency in the\\nsoftware development process. That is, that is one of the,\\none of the key points I want to push through this. So if, if at the end of the\\nday, if, if one thing you want to take out of the talk, you\\nwould want to at least take that digital infrastructure is as critical as our physical infrastructure. And one of the ways they\\'re\\nimposing that criticality is to push for more transparency, right? And what, what is, what\\nthese all regulations mean is that it incentivizes us\\nto be more transparent. How does it incentivize\\nus, incentivize that? All the transparency information which we, which are more was in the\\nprivate domain where in the case of a B2B, it\\'s essentially\\na private contract was enforced through a private contract. Now it\\'s in the public domain. So you are required by regulation to be, to provide these transparency information. It\\'s no longer an optional where\\nit\\'s a customer to customer option or a, it\\'s a, it\\'s now required if you\\nare a software producer and it\\'s a legal framework, it also provides a deterministic way of finding liability, right? So you are, you are able\\nto provide accountability by providing this transparency. So what, how do you enable providing\\nthis transparency? The, the way to enable it\\nis providing standards to, on how to provide this information. So how do I, how do I, sorry, how do I represent the, the\\ningredients of a software today? So the ingredients of the software today can be represented in formats like OWASP, OpenSSF, SPDX and Cyclone DX and SWID. SWID is not essentially\\na language to represent, but it\\'s, it\\'s included in in the Nest standards at this point. So in order to represent\\nyou the ingredients of the software, so when I say\\ningredients of the software, what are the, what are the components of the software you\\'re using? So what are the libraries you are using? What is the, the build,\\nbuild system you are using? The in order to represent that. These are the standards you\\ncan use Cyclone DX, SPDX and in order to represent\\nvulnerabilities in the, in your software. So when you are including dependencies, and if the dependencies come\\nalong with the, with certain vulnerabilities after you release it, how do you represent that information? That is called VEX,\\nvulnerability exchange. Cyclone DX has a VEX profile. OpenVEX is another format from OpenSSF, you\\'ll see a standard theme again, these are OAS and OpenSSF are the two standard bodies or standard creation bodies\\nin, in the SBOM field, which is, which is popular. So I\\'ll be referring to their formats and how do I, so once I, once\\nI represent the ingredients of the software, how\\ndo I represent the SDLC or the maturity in my SDLC, right? So the way you do it is using, using one of these, one of these formats. There, there, there\\'s a format\\ncalled In-TOTO supported by OpenSSF and Cyclone DX, again, has a way of representing your SDLC maturity. And there are maturity\\nmodels defined by, defined by different corporates and also by NIST. NIST has SSDF. Then SLSA is is something which, which is essentially a scorecard\\non how mature your SDLC is. And S2c2fF is, is is another framework\\nprovided by Microsoft. Again, OpenSSF these are all supported formats within OpenSSF. So what does it, what\\ndoes adhering to standards and providing more\\ntransparency mean for GRC? So as a, as an assurance person, what do I get if it like, between I, the time I submitted my talk and, and today my team has\\ncreated about 20 new repos and 10 like five different products. And what it has meant for\\nme is a lot of catch up as an assurance person, you know, like as an assurance person,\\nwhat I\\'m trying to do is, is my team following the SDLC practices, is my software secure? In order to answer those\\nquestions, I need to keep track, constantly keep track of this. If I\\'m doing it manually,\\nwhich is the current way of doing it, it kind of burns\\nmy team kind of being this, in this catch up mode all the time, right? So, and the 2.0 or providing transparency through SBOMs and having them automate\\nautomatically being generated in your SDLC gives you a way\\nof having an inventory of all the things happening here in your, in your organization at\\nany point of time, right? So it gives you a high fidelity inventory of all the things in your, in your software at the same time, all the things happening\\nin your SDLC, that\\'s, that\\'s the way I see how one can get the best use of GRC. Even, even if we are not\\nincentivized by regulations. If, if you\\'re not a healthcare or a health medical device\\nprovider, if you\\'re not working with, with the Department of Defense or any federal agencies, if\\neven if you are just working with commercial providers,\\none of the best BEN benefits of moving towards SBOM or\\nthe, and the attestation or all the, all the\\ntransparency exchange formats is that you get a better fidelity\\ninventory of your software and the software dependencies, right? And that reduces a burn on your, on your team at the same\\ntime, it reduces the, the time you take to respond\\nto any incidents, right? And oops, for a security team, again, one of the be the, again,\\nthe, the common theme is your, your inventory is high fidelity\\nby having a high fidelity inventory, you can, you can\\nrespond better, better you can, you can target mitigations. Your, the implementation of policy is going to be better, right? So your, your implementation\\nof policy can be automated. That\\'s the key part, right? So what are the tools? So this is, this is a key part. One of the discussions we, we were having before this talk is the tools\\nare not yet mature, which I, which I agree with what my\\nthought was, is to highlight some of the tools in the market\\nfor you to go and explore and be able to start\\nyour investigation on, on, on SBOMs, right? So the first thing, first\\ntool you, you would want to consider is the how do\\nyou generate these SBOMs, how do you integrate\\nthese SBOMs into your, into your SDLC, right? So in open there is, there\\nis open and commercial tools. I\\'ll, I\\'ll, like, I\\'m kind\\nof walking through the slides so you can, you can refer to the slides and I\\'ll also share the slides\\nat the end, end of the talk. So again, so there are\\nenough generation tools. So what do I, one of the key\\nquestions is, okay, what, how do I generate, so how do I\\ngenerate the different parts? For example, you can use\\nCDXGen, I\\'m, I\\'m gonna be, you can refer to other tools\\nin, in the, in the slides, you can use CDXGen to create\\nyour SBOM, you can use CDXGen to create what is called attestations. When I say attestations,\\nwhen, what do I mean by that is you give information\\nin a stat machine readable format about your SDLC. What was my build process? Did I have a GitHub pull request? Did I have a secure environment\\nfor, for, for build? Did I have a test environment for my, after my build, did I test,\\ndid I run static analysis? All those can be represented\\nin the form of attestation. So at the end of it, and\\nyou want non-repudiation. So essentially you want\\nto associate the, the, the information which has been\\ngiven to a specific person. You want accountability\\nand non repeatability. It\\'s that, that, that is given\\nby a digital signing process. OpenSSF provides you what\\nis called a Sigstore, which will let you sign these, these standard documents or the documents you create using CDXGen or OpenSSFs tools. And CDXGen itself has a, has a signing tool which you can use. How do you distribute these? Currently the, the mode of distribution for, for these languages is using these, using\\nthe artifacts repository. Just the way you would\\ndistribute your executables and your, your libraries and packages, you would\\nuse the same, same to, to distribute the these documents, these signed the documents, right? What, what happens to Open OSS then? Like we have a huge OSS dependency. What happens to OSS? So there are services\\nwhich are coming along, which are trying to bridge\\nthe gap as a OSS developer. If you\\'re a OSS contributor,\\nyou don\\'t have to worry about, but there are services which\\nwill take your package, build it in a secure environment and provide an assured\\nservice, which will say, these are the dependencies, these are the, this is SBOM, at the same\\ntime, this is a, the, the, it, it gives you a\\nservice on top of a, on top of the OSS package, which\\nwill give you the SBOM and, and ability to track the\\nvulnerabilities, right? And how do you manage it? So now that I have a\\ncollection, I have hundreds of SBOM dependencies. Now how do I quantify my, my risk, which is going into my software, or how do I let my customer\\nknow how to manage it, right? So the, the way you do it there\\nin OSS there is we build a tool called dependency tracker, and it\\'ll consume all the SBOMs and build, build you a beautiful graph of what is all your dependencies and through which you can visualize where is the risk coming from and if you can mitigate it or not, right? And there are industry\\ndriven tools as well. So is this enough for you to adapt to the tool? No, because there is\\nstill gaps on how do you, how do you make the best use of SBOMs? So when I say how, how do I, how do I impose a policy\\non somebody saying that if you are not building\\nin a secure environment, this package will not be released, right? So that kind of policy\\ncodification is not possible today because the tools are not yet ready. Okay? So that, that, that, those\\nare some of the, some of the opportunities which are left and, and tools there, there\\'s still tools, not the maturity of the tools\\nnot, not ready yet, right? So even though I say the maturity\\nof the tools are not there yet, you can still kind of start small because we are moving towards\\nthe trend of more transparency and the SBOM is in and, and the VEX or the vulnerability exchange\\nor is here to stay, right? And the way you start is\\nsmall, try to understand, identify one critical competent,\\nyou want to add SBOM to. Add SBOM first and then add attestation and then add vulnerability exchange, and then add end of\\nlife cycle information. So that will give you one cycle of essentially executing how to integrate SBOM and you can redefine, so like I, I kind of had the same lecture for, for the, for, for my students in Western Washington. One of the ways I tend to describe SBOMs is it is not\\ndoing anything different than your existing vulnerability management. It\\'s just kind of having\\nan alternative way of doing the same thing. It gives you more ways to automate your existing vulnerability management at the same time\\nenforcing policies, right? So you as a GRC or, or as a governance person,\\none thing you can see this, see this as, as an, as\\na viable alternative for imposing policies on your SDLC and also managing vulnerabilities, right? That\\'s it for my talk. With that, if you have questions,\\nplease do come to the mic. I\\'ll try to repeat the question\\nso that it\\'s, it\\'s audible. - [Man] Hi, thank you\\nso much for your talk. If you could look into\\nyour crystal ball, if we, we magically get to 3.0, what would policy as code look like? - [Manoj] So there are, so policy as code very tactically\\nwould look like, it would look like something like a,\\nif you have ref, if you have known, known OPA, so open policy agent. So it\\'s, it\\'s essentially\\nonce you codify your, your, your all your infrastructure and your, and your dependencies,\\nyou now have a ability to enforce on top of it using essentially logical programming, right? And how do you, how do you add that logical programming layer? That is one of the ways to do it is OPA. So that\\'s how I see it. That\\'s the, that\\'s the\\nnatural progression. So natural progression\\ntowards more automation. So the first part is\\nproviding transparency. You get a beautiful visualization of all the things which\\nis happening in your SDLC. Now, once you have a visualization of all the things happening\\nin your SDLC, I can now say, okay, turn this on, turn this off. Now I need to, instead of\\ndoing that manually, going to the team and saying,\\nokay, turn this on, or make your build\\nenvironment more secure. Now I just push a policy document which just gets into their build machine and stops either at the build process or at their output output\\nprocess where it says, now you haven\\'t followed\\nthe certain build policies, which I asked you to, your SBOM says that, so I\\'m not going to let you release. And that is the eventual goal and how, how you are able to gate it. One of the ways is OPA,\\nwhich I was referring to, but there are several ways to do it. Yeah, thank you. - [Man] So is there a risk of having that transparency data out there? - [Manoj] Yes, that\\'s\\na, that\\'s awesome pin. So I was, I was in the OAS\\ntalk or OAS workshop yesterday, and there was a similar question. The, the the amount of\\nexposure you want to, or amount of transparency\\nyou want to provide to the customer, it\\nstill is, is your choice. So for example, in case of\\nexecute order, there is an, there\\'s a minimum set of elements you need to provide to the government. So that that, that minimum\\nset of element still is a, is a con, is a, is is a, a customization you can work\\nwith your customer, right? So you can work with your\\ncustomer to figure out what is the, what is the level of transparency they want\\nwithin the SBOM you don\\'t have to provide the same, you don\\'t have to provide all the information\\nwhich you generate internally with to your customer. You can, you can filter that\\nout in order for you to address that risk, which you\\'re talking about. Do I want to give out all my, all my build configurations\\nto my customer? No, right? But you do want as a GRC person, security\\nassurance person inside your team to know what this, what\\nis happening in your, in your organization. So SBOMs will give you that visibility, but as a governance, you\\ncan decide whether this is worth sending to the customer\\nand taking the risk or not. - [Man] Hi, any thoughts on accuracy of SBOM? If you think about a development process and your, your teams use\\nlike SCA tools to identify what they\\'ve brought in those STA tools. SCA tools of course are not perfect. So they misidentify a library version and with no ill intent, the\\nSBOM has inaccurate data in it. Any, have you heard like\\ndiscussion about, you know, just that, that nature within something that\\'s then gonna become\\npotentially illegal, you know, or a regulatory item, you know, the SBOM, but if, if the SBOM is inaccurate through just tool fault, be\\ncurious any thoughts and. - [Manoj] So would would\\nlike I would rephrase that to be would wouldn\\'t that I would re, I guess rephrase\\nthat to say that wouldn\\'t that actually increase the\\naccountability on the tool? So giving the false state through SBOM actually increases the\\ntransparency on where that false statement comes\\nfrom, which is, which is how I see the value of SBOM\\nin that you have created a, a pipeline where now you have full log of chain of events for you\\nto say what has happened, which tool has given you the\\nstatement why it has landed in SBOM, right? Now you have the accountability given that you can, you can go back and create the chain of, you\\nhave created the chain of log, now you can go back and\\nset the accountability to, to the tool maker, right? So now the liability is\\nshifted towards the person who actually gave the statement\\ninstead of instead of you. And that that is okay for me. As far as SBOMs are concerned. - [Cassie] Hi, Cassie\\nCrossley, Schneider Electric, I have about 4,000 SBOMs we\\'ve generated so I can help a bit on this one. So from SCA tools, the confidence rating is from about 15% to about 85% for most of\\nwhat\\'s generated out of, out of the SCA tools. The lower ones are ones that are firmware that are pretty old and have copy paste of\\nlibraries instead of any kind of package management or anything of that nature and commercial. So it, you know, the SCA tools can identify\\nlike that net libraries, but if you purchase libraries\\nfrom some company, you know, it may not recognize those. Also, if you\\'ve back ported any, any security patches, you know,\\nit\\'ll just identify a version or if there are similar versions,\\nlike very little changes between certain things,\\nit\\'s not gonna do it. So I have seen quite a number. So for those, especially\\nwhen we\\'re, we need to have high fidelity and quality, we have our dev\\nteams check that and verify it and that\\'s why I\\'m able\\nto determine the quality. You know, factor those built from the CICD pipeline, we still see, you know, with YTO and other ones errors, but\\nthen we just correct it. During the, when it actually generates it. - [Manoj] One the continuing point here is because of the SBOM, you\\nhit the transparency on it. And you are able to\\neither reduce trust on the tool or work around it. - [Cassie] Yes and we definitely\\nwork with the SEA vendors. - [Manoj] Right.\\n- [Cassie] To let them know the false positives and negatives. So that they\\'re improving\\ntheir tools also. - [Manoj] Yeah.\\n- [Cassie] Yep. - [Manoj] Thank you.', 'drive': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uJTVN0105JW_JTSGgp22u--dAvlWa1pq'}, {'url': 'https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2024/dont%20worry%20about%20your%20toiletim%20just%20hacking%20it', 'title': \"Don't Worry About Your Toilet...I'm Just Hacking It\", 'date': 'May 09, 2024', 'text': \"As part of RSAC Sandbox, the IoT Village will run different labs and hacking demos.

I hope you\\'re enjoying sitting down, giving your feet a rest. My name is Liora Herman and I am the co-founder of AppSec Village, over in the corner over there. We\\'re a nonprofit focused on\\napplication security awareness, education, and building community. I have the unique pleasure of introducing today Ben Schmerler, who is going to give us\\nthe first toilet talk. So you guys are part of the first audience to enjoy a night, or an afternoon, of toilet talk with Ben Schmerler. Let\\'s give him a round applause, please. (upbeat music)\\n(audience applauding) - Thanks everybody for\\nattending. Really appreciate it. I hope we have a very\\nmature conversation today. Very serious stuff. I don\\'t wanna hear any\\njokes, any laughs at all. We\\'re talking serious business. Anyway, now I\\'m gonna talk\\nabout why we hack toilets. Before we start, here\\'s\\nthe little disclaimer. Make sure that you don\\'t\\nhack your own toilet or your neighbor\\'s toilet\\nor anyone else\\'s toilet. That would be bad. We shouldn\\'t do that. We\\'ve got our disclaimer\\nin. All right, great. So who am I? My name\\'s Ben. I work for a company called\\nIndependent Security Evaluators. We\\'re a cybersecurity consultancy based outta Baltimore, Maryland, but we have people who\\nwork all around the world. We focus on white box\\napplication security assessments, network pen tests, design\\nconsulting, things like that. But the way I put it is,\\nif you have a product or a service or a network and you wanna find out\\nwhat\\'s the real vulnerability and you want to get it done\\nby real ethical hackers using real ethical hacking techniques and not just a scanner, we\\'re the people who can help you. What do I do? I talk to clients about\\nhow to approach testing in the right way. It\\'s always different. Every approach to testing should be unique based on the assets\\nwe\\'re trying to protect and the thing we\\'re looking at. I talk about scoping, cadence depth, and also I like to talk to people about how they talk about security. I find that often people\\ntalk about security in a very negative light. Fear-based, you know? \"We better do this or else.\" And yes, of course we\\nshould make things secure so that we\\'re not afraid\\nof bad stuff happening, but there\\'s also a positive\\nway to talk about security, which is to say, you can say that we care so much about security that we\\'re willing to\\nput ourselves out there. So I really advocate for that as well. At ISE, we like to do some weird stuff. Was anyone here at the\\nSandbox last year in 2023? Any hands? Cool. So last year at the Sandbox we brought a toilet seat that we hacked, and we created this little guy. I call him Tim the Toilet. We even gave him eyes and a little cigar that\\'s popping out of his mouth. The way these things usually\\nwork at our operation is that somebody like me makes\\na sarcastic comment and says, \"Hey, we should hack a toilet.\" And then someone else says, \"That\\'s a great idea!\\nWe should run with it!\" And then we inevitably do it. But yeah, we brought it here last year and I\\'m gonna talk a little bit about that and what went into it. We got a lot of reactions and responses. Obviously this is meant to\\nbe a little bit provocative. I want people to see it\\nand have some questions. The most obvious question when\\npeople would come up to us at a conference like RSA is,\\n\"Why is there a toilet here?\" And this brings me great joy because it gives me an opportunity to bring out my sarcastic side and say, \"Well, you know, RSA is a long conference and Cyber Cafe is going, and\\nafter you have a few coffees, you just kind of need to\\ntake a break a little bit.\" Or I was telling people, \"This is actually an\\nold historic landmark.\" The toilet was actually here first, but when they were building\\nthe Moscone Center, they really had to incorporate this historic landmark into it. People did ask if the\\ntoilet actually works. And I laughed at them at\\nfirst, like, \"Of course not. Of course it doesn\\'t work.\" But after a little while, maybe I kind of wished\\nit did a little bit. Is this a troll? And is this what people\\nmean by immature targets? I\\'d like to think that the\\ntarget isn\\'t so immature, it\\'s more that the targeters are immature. So that\\'s some of the\\nresponses we had from it. So more importantly,\\nwhat did we actually do and what was the actual goal of this? So there were a few devices we brought. It wasn\\'t just the toilet seat. We reverse engineered several devices that communicated on wireless spectrums, both Bluetooth and wifi. And we reverse engineered these devices using a black box format to\\ncreate our own applications to issue them commands. So in the case of the toilet seat, we were able to make the\\ntoilet seat heat up on demand. We were able to make\\nit make light patterns and things like that. And we basically just\\ncompromised the device entirely. Similarly, we did something\\nlike this with a robotic vacuum where people could make\\nthe vacuum pick up M&Ms that we scattered around the\\ncarpet and stuff like that, as well as some Bluetooth light bulbs that had different colors\\nand things like that, getting them to do various things. Part of the purpose of\\nthis is multifaceted. These demonstrations\\nare meant for everyone. Not everybody who comes to RSA is maybe highly technical. We wanna demonstrate what can actually be\\ndone with these devices. And to be perfectly direct, many of the things that we did here didn\\'t take us a long time to develop. Maybe developing the\\napps took a long time, but creating the exploits\\nwere not that complicated. So part of the point of this is that if these devices exist in the world and we were able to in a couple hours come up with ways to send it instructions, there must be a way to\\ndo this with other stuff. And I think the big question I wanna sort of talk about\\ntoday and discuss with you guys is what are the broader implications in a world where millions or maybe billions of IoT\\ndevices exist and are growing? I don\\'t have the exact statistic, but if you look at the proliferation of IoT devices in networks,\\nit\\'s a parabolic growth. I mean, these things are\\ngrowing exponentially. We all use IoT devices,\\nthey exist everywhere. But I would really encourage you to sort of think outside\\nthe toilet a little bit when you\\'re thinking about this stuff. It\\'s not just about a toilet seat. We hacked the toilet seat\\nbecause it was a fun thing to do and it got people talking, but there are much broader implications. I think it\\'s pretty obvious,\\nas I mentioned before, that these devices are everywhere. To me, the definition of IoT is take something that is not digital that has any kind of\\nfunction in the world. It could be your refrigerator, it could be your parking\\nmeter, it could be your Fitbit, it could be the jacket you\\'re wearing or your headphones or whatever, and add some kind of communication or digital connectivity to this,\\nand now it\\'s an IoT device. And these things exist\\nall across the spectrum. We are all familiar with an Amazon Echo or a Nest thermostat or a Ring camera or any of these things, but\\nthese things exist in ways that a lot of people don\\'t see\\nor maybe don\\'t think about. So you can see, I showed\\nsome examples here of a plumbing instrument\\nthat looks for leaks, a heart monitor, something we actually did\\ndo a hack on in the past that you could read about on our website, even solar panels and things like that. And so while these devices will vary in terms of their\\nintended function, right? An Amazon Echo is a very basic device. It plays music, you can order\\nstuff through it, whatever, and the heart monitor has obviously a much more clinical point, a lot of the things that\\nmake these things IoT devices are actually quite similar. They\\'re all using things like wifi, they\\'re all using things like Bluetooth. And so what does it mean\\nwhen we can on a toilet seat use the same Bluetooth connection to manipulate the toilet seat that we would with,\\nsay, a plumbing sensor? Doing the demonstration on the toilet seat only means we can do\\nthis with other things. It\\'s also important to note that if we were able to\\nfind these vulnerabilities on the toilet seat, that\\nvulnerabilities just exist. One of the big problems when\\npeople talk about security is that they say, \"Well,\\nwe\\'ve secured our product.\" And maybe that\\'s true in the broad sense, but nothing is ever 100% secure. Think about everybody who\\ncame into this building today came in and they were\\ninspected by the guards, they walked through the metal detectors, they went through your stuff. But I don\\'t think anyone\\'s so naive to believe that there\\nisn\\'t a way to compromise the security of this building, right? Security is just a state of being, and nothing is a 100% secure. So we should recognize that these vulnerabilities\\nexist across the spectrum, whether it\\'s a consumer device or maybe an infrastructure device or a healthcare device\\nor anything like that. And so how do we deal\\nwith these challenges? And do we even understand what it means when these devices are connected? You look at the box and the\\nbox says, \"It does this, it communicates on this spectrum,\"\\nall of this other stuff. But what is the device actually doing? Is it getting updated? What kind of data does it send\\noutward to the manufacturer? Does it collect data of\\nother things on your network for maybe legitimate or\\nnon-legitimate purposes? I don\\'t want to terrify\\nanybody about this, but we need to understand what\\nthese things ultimately mean. There\\'s also the broader concept. I mean, I imagine people\\nare generally familiar with the term \"shadow IT\", right? Devices that exist in a network that people don\\'t know about. I think you first started hearing this maybe as people started bringing their own smartphones to work and\\niPads and tablets and stuff. But now this is extending to other devices in the workplace or in offices. Wearables, even things that\\naren\\'t connected to the network. Consider the idea that\\nif you have a smart watch and that watch has a camera\\non it or a listening device and it\\'s not connected to the network, it\\'s still has security implications. We just need to be mindful of this stuff because now everything is talking\\nand everything is exposed. There\\'s also IoT devices that\\ncould be rogue access points and rogue cell phone signals. Just because it looks like something doesn\\'t mean it does the function\\nthat it\\'s purported to do. And so we need to keep in mind\\nthat these shadow IoT devices have significant\\nimplications in our lives. The challenges of securing an\\nIoT environment are numerous, so the first concept I want\\nto talk about is trust. When you go out and you\\npurchase an IoT device or you join it to your network\\nor any number of things, you really should be asking yourselves a number of questions about\\nthe people that made it. So first, who made the device, right? If I go to the Apple store\\nand I buy an Apple watch, there\\'s a relative level\\nof trust there, right? Apple as evidenced by the updates and patches that they put out there has some care for the\\nsecurity of their devices. They find a flaw, they issue\\na patch, it gets fixed, and you have a generally\\nsupported product. But will the smartwatch that you buy from a brand that you\\'ve never heard of that you found randomly\\non Amazon at a discount, do you have the same\\ntrust in that manufacturer to be able to take care of\\nthat device in the same way? And what does that mean\\nabout your use of the device and how it connects to your other things? How often are they testing these devices? How are they actually making sure that these devices are secure by the time they got to market? We have a tendency to\\nsee something very flashy and very useful for us,\\nand we want to use it and we want to get the utility out of it, but we don\\'t necessarily think about what was done on that device before. It\\'s a black box that we\\'re\\njust sort of trusting. We should really question that. Have they done any documentation\\nto prove this diligence? A lot of times you buy a product or you see a product on\\nthe shelves and it says, \"This is the most secure device.\" But all that is, is a box.\\nIt doesn\\'t mean anything. It talks about what encryption\\nlevels they\\'re doing, but they\\'re not talking about\\ntheir testing methodologies, they\\'re not talking about\\nany certifications they get, and they\\'re not necessarily\\npublicizing those things on their website or in\\ntheir documentation. And how do they store the data that comes back from these devices? So if I have a device that\\nis collecting important data, is that device just being used for me, or is that data being\\nfarmed off to some company that\\'s going to use it or maybe sell it or do any number of other things? We need to understand these things, and device manufacturers should be publicizing this information, otherwise we should actually\\nquestion how we use them. When it comes to integration, when you join a device to the network, what\\'s it doing on the\\nrest of the network? Is it opening up access to your internal traffic to the outside? Is this thing just\\nspeaking to other things within a local area, or is it actually sending information off? Does it collect any\\ngeneral network traffic? There are devices that are taking more information than they\\nneed just because they can. Everybody wants to have your data whether they need it or not. And will it create problems just because of the amount\\nof traffic it generates? We should really scrutinize\\ndevices before we deploy it. And I\\'m gonna get more into that later when we talk about the apply stuff. When it comes to maintenance, what do we need to know about\\nmaintaining these devices? When we join the Nest\\nthermostat to our home network, surely over the lifespan of that device, that is going to have some\\nkind of security patch that needs to be applied to it. And when we install it in grandma\\'s house to give her a nice new thermostat, what does she need to know about this so that when she is\\njoining it to her network, she\\'s not creating some\\npotential security flaw? What are some things we can do to make sure this device is\\nproperly patched and maintained? Chances are a lot of these devices, by the time you even unbox them and put them on the shelf and set them up, they probably already\\nhave a firmware update. I mean, we\\'ve all gone home\\nand purchased something and as soon as we turn it on, it looks for an update\\nand installs something. This is commonplace. So we need to be mindful\\nthat maintenance applies not only to PCs and servers\\nand iPads and stuff like that, but also these IoT devices. And then also what about the\\nend of life of these devices? These manufacturers, when they build them, they don\\'t intend to put these\\ndevices out for infinite use. They\\'re not gonna support\\nthem five years from now. They\\'re gonna move on to the next thing. And once a vulnerability exists, because remember,\\nvulnerability always exist, these vulnerabilities are\\nnot going to be taken care of by the manufacturer. We need need to be mindful of this, because that 10-year-old IoT device that\\'s no longer getting supported may present a critical weakness to something we actually care about. There\\'s also the idea of inherent flaws. So even if we do everything the right way, these vulnerabilities will still exist. The most secured products in the world can be broken if you put in enough time and effort and know-how. The goal of any kind of security practice should be to make things\\nvery difficult to break. Not impossible, but very difficult. The analogy I like to give\\na lot is personal health. So if you work out every\\nday and you eat healthy and you get a good night\\'s sleep and you do other sort\\nof healthy behaviors, there\\'s a very good chance you\\'re going to live a long healthy life, but it doesn\\'t guarantee anything. And there are no\\nguarantees with this stuff. So we just need to keep this in mind and we need to plan around\\nthose inherent flaws. Okay, I do all the things\\nto keep myself healthy, but I still get a checkup with my doctor. And if I need to take medical intervention to make myself healthier, I do it. Just because I put in a\\nfire system in my home or a fire suppression system\\nin my home to put out a fire doesn\\'t mean my house can\\'t catch on fire. So I get homeowners insurance to make sure that my home is protected and I have some coverage\\nfrom my liability. Last, there\\'s the concept\\nof evolving standards, and there\\'s really a couple\\nways to look at this. First is, sometimes when\\nthese vulnerabilities exist, they\\'ve always existed and it just takes someone\\nto really discover them. A few years ago we had the\\nfamous Log4j vulnerability, which was a major vulnerability that impacted lots of things. And when people like ISE\\nwere assessing these products for vulnerabilities before Log4j, it wasn\\'t like we were looking\\nfor Log4j vulnerabilities. We didn\\'t know about it. And then once that vulnerability\\nwas publicly disclosed, now we had to look at how we assessed every product in a different way because we have new information\\nabout these vulnerabilities. The other piece is\\nthose evolving standards will change the way we\\nlook at vulnerabilities, and those vulnerabilities\\nwill have a different impact based on the device\\nthat\\'s actually using it. So let\\'s talk about the\\npoint of hacking a toilet. So the real point of doing this is to look people straight in the eye and tell them that you need\\na spotlight on your toilet. It brings me great joy to go up to someone and seriously tell \\'em, \"Hey, could you just adjust this light and make the light swirl a little bit, just like the water going down a toilet?\" It brings me great joy to ask for that. Maybe you wanna fill the gaps at RSA when things are a little slow and you wanna name your toilet and keep your your brain moving. It is quite fun when I\\nhave a family dinner. I went to my niece\\'s birthday\\nparty a couple weeks ago and they asked, \"Ben, are\\nyou doing any travel soon?\" I said, \"Yeah, I\\'m\\ngoing to San Francisco.\" \"Oh, what are you doing there?\" \"I\\'m gonna talk about hacking toilets.\" And your aunt looks at you like, \"What did my nephew do with his life?\" It it, then finally, it\\'s really important that when you\\'re at your desk and you decide to\\nPhotoshop a Taco Bell logo that you can giggle and have a good time and get some joy outta your work. But the real reasons to\\nhack a toilet, jokes aside, is first to show it can be done. Like it or not, there\\'s a lot\\nof people who have skepticism about the importance of\\nwhether these things can occur or whether they\\'re meaningful or not. They are meaningful and it can happen, and people need to be aware of it. While this is a basic demonstration, I\\'m talking about a toilet seat now, the principles that we use to\\nreverse engineer a toilet seat can be applied to the heart monitor. And so if I can manipulate the\\ntoilet seat into heating up, does that mean that we can\\nmanipulate the heart monitor to register false readings about whether a heartbeat\\'s going? And the answer is yes. This is something that\\nwe were able to discover in a previous assessment years ago. It\\'s really important also\\nto learn and create awareness about these things in the world, right? Someone came up to me yesterday and they were talking about IoT devices and they were saying, \"This\\nis why I don\\'t do IoT, because anything can be broken.\" But imagine if we had that\\nattitude about the internet. In the mid \\'90s, I remember people, where we\\'re starting to\\nget into the internet and the idea of putting\\nin your credit card number to buy a book on Amazon was\\nvery intimidating for people. \"I don\\'t know if I want to do that. I\\'m not sure I really\\nwant to take that risk. What I\\'d really much rather\\ndo is take my credit card and put it into a machine and\\nthen put a carbon thing on it and then swipe it a bunch and write down the numbers\\nin a million places.\" I mean, that\\'s not secure either. But if we create an awareness about what the actual risks are and what can be done about it to make these things manageable, we can get the benefits of technology without exposing ourself\\nto unnecessary risk. I also think it\\'s really\\nimportant everywhere, and it\\'s not just applying to IoT devices, that we create what I would\\ncall a culture of security. And what does that really mean? It means that we incorporate security into the decisions we make\\non a day-to-day basis. So when we\\'re about to join\\na device to our network, we think about what is this\\ndevice, what does it do for us? How does it benefit to us?\\nAnd what are the risks? And if we actually are\\nmindful about these things, much like we would\\ntheoretically be mindful about the food we eat\\nor the air we breathe and things like that, we\\'re likely to have\\na much better outcome. So think about that every\\ntime you\\'re doing something. What impact does it have on my security and what can I do to make\\nmy culture of security a little bit better? And finally, we should provide\\nconfidence and dispel fears. So risks exist. Everything has a risk. Let\\'s just understand these\\nrisks, let\\'s accept the risk, and come up with a plan\\nto manage these risks instead of burying our heads in the sand or being Luddites and not\\naccepting technology at all because of this irrational fear. But the only way we can really do that is by educating people and\\ngiving them the opportunity to understand these things for themselves on a broader scale. So how do we apply this? And I broke this up into\\nthree different slides based on what your role might be, and maybe you have multiple\\nof these roles for yourself, or maybe some of it applies\\nand some of it doesn\\'t. Well, if you\\'re a consumer and\\nyou just have a home network and you just are purchasing these things, make sure you have some kind of inventory. Know what\\'s in your home,\\nknow what you\\'re hooking up, know what kind of maintenance it needs, understand that these\\ndevices are evolving. While the hardware is fixed and the hardware is\\nnot really gonna change when you purchase an IoT\\ndevice, generally speaking, the firmware that it\\'s running,\\nall the software behind it, these things will change over\\ntime, generally speaking. You should research- Oh, excuse me. You should research\\nproducts before buying them. So before you go out and say, \"Wow, this is a great wireless microphone and it only costs $20 on Amazon.\" Well, maybe you should read\\nup a little about this product and make sure it is what you think it is. Ask yourself what kind of\\ndata these things receive and how it can communicate. And I have a typo there. What I meant is threat\\nmodel your IoT devices. Now, for people who are\\nin penetration testing, they\\'re probably familiar\\nwith threat modeling, but if you\\'re not, the concept\\nof threat modeling is saying, \"I have an assets that I wanna secure and I\\'m gonna take the 10,000 foot view of understanding exactly\\nwhat I have out there. So, what are the assets I wanna protect? What are the things that are\\nin place to protect them? What do I have to do to\\nmaintain that protection? Who are the threat actors who are liable to potentially attack me?\" And just take a general overview so that we know the landscape\\nin which we\\'re working in. If you\\'re unfamiliar with threat modeling and you want to do something\\nlike this for yourself, come talk to me after the talk and I have an exercise I could\\nshare with you after the show that just sort of breaks it down in a very logical and basic\\nway for even the new person. Really important too to harden the rest of your devices and networks. So when you have IoT\\ndevices on your network, they could have flaws. How do you manage these flaws? By making sure that the\\nother things you use are also secured. So let\\'s say for the sake of argument that the Nest thermostat has\\nsome new flaw that\\'s found, but your other devices on your network are relatively secured and someone somehow gains a\\npoint of entry into your network through that Nest thermostat. Well, if the rest of your\\nnetwork\\'s relatively secured, maybe the impact of that\\nvulnerability isn\\'t so bad. Even if the vulnerability itself, a critical vulnerability that lets someone root into this Nest device is significant. Security is a broad thing and we have to look at\\nit from a broad level. Nothing is perfect, but if we create that layered security, we\\'re gonna have a much better outcome. And finally, just try and stay\\non top of the news, you know? When Log4j came out, it was a big deal. It was reported from\\nmany media publications, and obviously not every\\nvulnerability is gonna get that kind of exposure, but\\na lot of the big ones are. And when those big ones come out, make sure that you are well\\naware of what\\'s happening and have a path to address them. There\\'s other things to keep in mind too. So the FCC is about to have, they\\'re finalizing the\\nCyber Trust Mark program. I think these things are gonna help the average consumer as it moves forward. If you\\'re an integrator or an IT guy, somebody who is responsible\\nfor maintaining these devices, introducing these devices into networks, focus on your security first\\nand then your deployment. So again, there\\'s this rush\\nthat a lot of people have where it\\'s, \"Let\\'s get the\\ndevice in, let\\'s get it running. I really wanna make this thing work.\" But really it should be, \"What impact does this\\nhave on my security? What do I need to do to make sure that this device is\\nimplemented in a proper way, and then I\\'m going to deploy it.\" Layer security onto your network too. So just because your firewall\\nhas a security feature, don\\'t assume that that feature\\nis going to work perfectly. Take the steps to put other\\nthings on your network to make sure that you\\'ve got some backups, that you\\'ve got a safety\\nnet to protect yourself. If you\\'re an IT person and you\\'re dealing with a lot of end users who may be a little bit antsy, who wanna get their things going, it\\'s really important from\\na communication perspective to make sure that when\\npeople are adding devices to the network, that you\\'re\\nsort of an ally to them and that you\\'re making\\nthings easy and manageable. Sometimes IT people can\\nbe a little dismissive, they get a little annoyed with\\nend users who want things, but it\\'s a lot better to say to somebody, \"Hey, you wanna integrate\\nthis device into our network. It\\'s something I can do for you. I have to do X, Y, and Z before I do that and I should have a response\\nfor you by Thursday\" or whatever the thing is. If you provide that level of transparency and clarity to people about your intent and what you\\'re going to do, you\\'ll generally get\\nmuch better user buy-in for those sorts of things. And we do this because we want to avoid the shadow IT situation where people are joining\\nthings to networks because they don\\'t want\\nto get along with IT. Really, IT should be\\nan ally to the end user and there should be a\\ndialogue back and forth. They shouldn\\'t be opposed to one another. It\\'s also important to\\nhave adequate monitoring and asset management. Several people during the\\nevent have come up to me and asked me or talked to me about the challenges they\\'re having, even identifying all the IoT\\ndevices on their network. They may not appear traditional to certain network scans\\nand things like that. You need to have some kind\\nof broader visibility. It\\'s very easy to see a\\nWindows PC on a network or a server or something like\\nthat or a network switch. Much harder for especially\\nbleeding edge IoT devices for those things to be easily identified. And finally, consider\\nisolating the device. If it\\'s something that\\'s really risky, Sven in his previous talk was talking about these MRI machines running with old computers\\nconnected to \\'em, the strategy to deal\\nwith this extreme risk of an MRI machine using a Windows 7 PC is to isolate this on the network, to do something so it can\\'t\\nmaybe connect to other stuff. I see a gentleman\\nlaughing in the audience. I came from a world before I did this where I was in managed IT services, and it was astonishing how expensive these clinical devices are using inherently insecure technology. We have to work around\\nthat, unfortunately. If the devices isn\\'t good, we can\\'t get rid of the MRI machine. It just doesn\\'t work that way. Finally, if you\\'re a developer, let\\'s say you\\'re building these products or these applications, there\\'s\\nthings that you need to do to make this good for your end user. First, you need to put\\nsecurity into design and not after building,\\nincluding threat modeling. A lot of times I hear\\nfrom startup companies, people developing\\nproducts, they talk about, \"We have to get to market,\\nwe have to get to market. We have to go for our next funding. We have to do this, we have to do this.\" That\\'s great and all,\\nand I 100% am sympathetic to the business side of these concerns, but there is no business if the product is completely compromised. If nobody has faith in your brand or if there\\'s a major data\\nbreach, you don\\'t have anything. It doesn\\'t matter whether\\nyou got to market or not. Security built in design will also make the price\\nof implementing security much, much less. It\\'s much harder to secure\\nthings after the fact than during design. We advocate for doing design consulting as you\\'re building a product. And then when that product\\'s ready to go, then do a pen test on it like you would do with anything else. Really important to regularly\\nassess your products and don\\'t take the results for granted. Sometimes people want to\\ncheck the box off, right? They say, \"Well, we did\\nthe assessment, it\\'s done. We found these things, everything\\'s cool. See you later.\" Look, you\\'re not gonna test these products every day, all day. But you should have a cadence to it. You should say to yourself, \"This product, in order to deal with the\\nchanges to the product, the updates to the product, how we\\'ve continued to add features or updates or whatever it is, we need to make sure that\\nthese things are still secure. That as the security landscape changes and the vulnerability landscape changes that we\\'ve now assessed to\\nkeep those things in mind.\" Make it a part of your\\nsoftware development lifecycle. Really important also to\\nseek out independent analysis and not just trust your internal teams. Internal teams are great. Internal teams should\\nbe testing these things and we should try to get them\\nto find those vulnerabilities. But even better than that\\nis going to a third party, someone who has no bias in the situation, who is just there to find vulnerabilities, and ask them to take a look. We all have blind spots. People have different perspectives. When we have analysts work on assessments, we often reassign them\\nto different projects and we rotate them around because we want different perspectives when doing security assessments. You should seek out that kind of independent analysis to check your work. People make mistakes. That\\'s why you have to\\nwork with third parties. It\\'s really important to document, and finally, utilize\\nthe approved standards that are out there. A lot of times when people\\nare developing things, especially on the web application side, they\\'re using third party\\nlibraries, other things, and sometimes they use things\\nthat aren\\'t properly vetted. If you\\'re adding something\\ninto your product and you don\\'t know what it does, you\\'re creating a gigantic risk and it\\'s one that you can\\'t control because you didn\\'t build\\nthat part of the product. I have one more lesson. If you really need to learn\\nabout application security more, you can scan this QR code right here. I\\'ll leave it up for a minute or two. And we will ship you a\\nfree copy of \"Hackable,\" which is a book written by our executive partner, Ted Harrington. It talks about a lot of philosophies about some of the things\\nI talked about today. So, how to secure applications\\nand networks properly. And it also gets into other things like dealing with maybe\\nthe internal politics of making sure that you\\nget the resources you need to do the testing that you need to do, to how to think about\\nwhat kind of resources you should put into something based on the value of the asset behind it. So check it out, and I\\'m happy to talk\\nwith you more about it. And with all that said, any questions? I\\'m happy to answer anything. You can clap for me, sure! (Ben chuckles)\\n(audience applauding) Thank you. But please, any questions? Happy to answer them if I can. Whoever, just you can go\\nup to the mic I guess. - Hi. Yes.\\n- So as the end user, okay? If I buy a IoT device, how do I even know, I guess are there any tools\\nor resource available for me to do some sort of verification to say at least that the IoT device does not have any malware loaded, right? To get onto your network\\nand steal your data. - Yeah. You\\'re always going to be dealing with incomplete information. And I mentioned earlier that one of the challenges\\nhere is trust, right? So when you\\'re looking at it, I mean, first, what\\'s the brand name? As I said, I don\\'t think\\nyou have to think too hard about buying an Apple IoT device\\nor something by Microsoft. These are responsible companies\\nwho, they make mistakes, they have vulnerabilities, yes, but Microsoft and Apple and some of these other manufacturers are going to fix those things\\nwhen they\\'re discovered. So that\\'s the first thing. If you\\'re not really sure, I would go to the company\\'s website. And these companies really\\nshould publicize stuff about what they do for security. They\\'re not gonna tell\\nyou every vulnerability they\\'ve ever discovered on their website, but I don\\'t think it\\'s really a problem for most of these companies\\nto be able to say, \"This is the general\\napproach we have to security. These are the principles we operate on.\" And they should be able to demonstrate some kind of diligence there. Make sure once, let\\'s\\nsay you go through that, you feel like you\\'re pretty\\ncomfortable with the device and then you get it at home. Make sure when you buy it that you look at the documentation, that you understand how the\\nmaintenance procedures go. Maybe you look at some user reviews to see what kind of\\nmaintenance is out there or what kind of things\\nyou have to deal with. It just takes a little bit of diligence, and I don\\'t want it to\\nsound like you have to go through hell and high\\nwater to do this stuff. It\\'s some basic stuff. It\\'s just not being blind about it and just jumping right in. You should just take a\\nlittle bit of patience. I hope that answers your question. Sure. Yes? - I guess I\\'d echo one of\\nthe things that you said, which is, don\\'t put IoT devices on your- Like if you have a corporate, if any of you are responsible\\nfor your corporate network, don\\'t put IoT devices on the\\ncorporate network, right? - Yeah.\\n- That\\'s how Target got hacked 12 years ago.\\n- Yeah. It was an HVAC. - Yeah. HVAC vendor. So it\\'s just really bad practice. So second thing is, as a home user, I have every bit of\\nconfidence that IoT vendors will never solve the\\nsecurity problem themselves. What would you recommend as a, I know they\\'re not gonna fix it, but I have my own home network. So would you say, hey, segment all those onto their own thing and then something at kind of the gateway level? - I think I\\'m a little\\nless pessimistic than that in the sense that the right vendors will maintain this stuff. As I said, you don\\'t have to worry with trusted vendors as much. But I think what you talked\\nabout with segmentation is a really good idea. And also just consider, the\\nactions you\\'re going to take to secure these devices or\\nreconfigure your network are really gonna be different. A vulnerability to an IoT\\ndevice means a lot different to a home in a rural environment as opposed to a corporate network. Let\\'s say a device has a Bluetooth low energy vulnerability, right? But your house is in the middle of nowhere and the only way to\\ncommunicate over Bluetooth is basically a short distance. Well, you know what, I\\'m not too worried about that vulnerability \\'cause no one\\'s ever gonna\\ntake advantage of it. But in an office environment they might. That vulnerability might\\nmean a lot different because of the context. So I would keep that in mind\\ntoo before taking any actions. And this is where threat\\nmodeling comes in. What could actually happen if this vulnerability\\nwas taken advantage of? And if the answer is nothing, well, then I wouldn\\'t even\\nworry about it too much. But if the answer is, \"They\\ncould steal my tax returns or run my credit card\"\\nor something like that, those are much more impactful. Or in the case of medical\\ndevices, cause health concerns, and now we\\'re talking about\\nlife and death stuff here. - Yeah, thanks. So one of the things I wanted to mention is I appreciate you talking\\nabout medical devices \\'cause I work in that segment. What about devices that\\nare have legacy software? How do you manage those? Because they\\'re almost unpatchable, and if it\\'s a medical device, right? You have probably 20,000,\\n30,000 of \\'em out there in medical device families. That\\'s the challenge I\\nface, is legacy software. - So this is about basically, it\\'s like what can you control\\nand what can\\'t you control? It\\'s like, what\\'s the phrase? Accept the things I can control and be at peace or something. I\\'m bad with those expressions. But you can\\'t control, especially in the medical device field where these are maybe\\nsix, seven figure devices and the company... I remember I worked with a\\nmedical practice one time and they had an imaging machine, and the imaging machine was\\nusing a Windows XP machine, and the manufacturer wanted 200 grand to upgrade the PC that it was talking to, and they\\'re like, \"We\\'re\\na medical practice. We can\\'t spend just $200,000\\nto get rid of this issue.\" There are things that they\\ncould do to mitigate it though. So the other gentleman\\nmentioned network segmentation. That\\'s a good start. Network monitoring and traffic monitoring. Things like EDR systems or\\nSMS, those types of things. If you\\'re in the context of, medical devices and\\nmedical practices apply, if you\\'re dealing with\\nsensitive information, well, if we\\'re monitoring\\nthe traffic on the network and looking for unusual behavior, at least we\\'ll know if someone\\'s trying to exploit this stuff so that we can take quick intervention and mitigate the issue. We might not be able to solve\\nthe problem, the core issue, but we can put things around this that make the impact of that\\nvulnerability way less severe. Also, this is why pen\\ntests exist, you know? When you\\'re doing a pen test, and it sounds like you definitely should based on what you\\'re talking about, you should say, \"This is\\nwhat we have on our network. These are the things that are\\nmaybe a little more typical,\" and the pen tester will\\nprobably shrug at it. And then say, \"But we also\\nhave these weird things,\" and be transparent about it. Because a good pen tester is going to see what they can exploit based on that. And then based on the results, you can take the corrective actions that are most appropriate. So sometimes it\\'s okay\\nto have a vulnerability if you know how you\\'re gonna\\ndeal with it after the fact. So that\\'s kind of how I would approach it. Any other questions? All right, cool. Well, thanks very much everybody. My contact information\\'s here. You can find me on LinkedIn. You got my email, bschmerler@ise.io. I\\'m over at the IoT Village\\nspace over in the corner there. Happy to talk to anybody. I\\'m\\nhere for a couple more hours. And again, thanks so much.

If you know me, you know\\nthat\\'s very strange. All right. Man. All right, it\\'s 12:20, so we\\'ll start. Hi, my name is Alex Weinert. I\\'m the VP for Identity\\nSecurity at Microsoft, and I\\'m here to talk to you today about The Storm-0558 Attack. This is the be nice and you\\'ll be videoed and that sort of thing. And just by show of hands,\\nwho here has played, and this is for probably people with white beards, but \"Mad Libs\" the game, \"Mad Libs,\"\\nlike long car trips, okay, about half of you. \"Mad Libs\" is this game\\nwhere you don\\'t really know what the like nouns and adjectives\\nand subjects are gonna be when you start, and so you pick some words and then later on, like you\\nfill it in and hilarity ensues. And I have the world\\'s least\\nfun version of \"Mad Libs,\" it\\'s like the abstract I find myself writing every year, right? And essentially, there will be some massive\\nnation-state attack, there will be new techniques, and you know, because we really believe\\nthat as a security community, we have to share data, like we need to share\\ninformation and share learnings, we\\'ll talk about it, right? So that\\'s kind of the spirit of this, is we wanna talk about it. Now, the thing that was funny\\nis when I wrote this abstract, I had this idea, I was like,\\n\"I should really just save this and then replace the words next year.\" And then at some point I wanna\\nstart submitting abstracts which is like, I don\\'t know\\nwhich attack it\\'s gonna be, I\\'ll just talk about\\nthe latest one, right? Because the sort of the advanced\\npersistent threat actors and the really, you know, nation-state base and that sort of thing is happening more and more. So this year\\'s talk is about Storm-0558. This is a China based threat\\nactor that we\\'ve been tracking for a while, that managed to forge tokens and impact acquisition of customer email for 22 organizations and\\nabout 502 individual users, and that\\'s what we\\'re\\ngonna talk about today. Now, this is a crime story, right? Like there was a crime\\nperpetrated, somebody broke in and stole data that they were\\nnot entitled to see, right? And so we\\'re gonna play\\nthis out like a crime story. We\\'re gonna introduce you to the scene. You know, you can imagine\\nthe camera panning over the foggy city, right? We\\'re gonna introduce\\nyou to the characters, a little backstory on our players, you\\'re gonna see the\\nfrenetic crazy moments of the crime and how that played out, and then we will get you\\nthe detectives on the stage and we\\'ll do the investigation, and finally, you know, to\\nclean up the crime scene and like any good story,\\nthere\\'s a moral at the end. So let\\'s set the scene. Now I understand I\\'m at RSA, and this is gonna be a funny\\nthing to talk about at RSA, but I wanna make sure we\\'re all level set, and just bear with me for five minutes, we\\'re gonna level set on identity and on public key cryptography. For some of you, you can\\ntake a nap, good time to check your mail, for the\\nrest of you pay attention because if you don\\'t know, if you can\\'t understand this well, you\\'re not gonna understand what happened and how it played out. So public key cryptography, we\\'re gonna create keys in pairs. There\\'s a private key and a public key. And by the way, I\\'m gonna use\\nthe sandbagging excuse of, I\\'m trying to simplify some\\nstuff, so don\\'t get pedantic or get pedantic with me later over a beer. Private keys and public\\nkeys created in pairs, and to be useful, the private\\nkey has to be kept secret and the public key has to be public. That\\'s why they call it a public key. We\\'re gonna talk about key acquisition and key leaks and key role, and if you\\'re not clear on\\nwhich key we\\'re talking about, it\\'s gonna be important to know that. So private keys are private,\\npublic keys are public. That\\'s supposed to be a billboard, you\\'re gonna see a lot of that. Okay, so from here, we can do, you know, what do we use it for? Well, one way we can use\\nit is for encryption, another way we can use\\nit is for authenticity, we can prove that we\\'re talking\\nto the right person, right? That we\\'re reading a message\\nfrom an authenticated sender. And so the way that that works is Alice wants to send Bob a message. Alice wants Bob to know\\nthat it came from her. So Alice creates a key pair and being a good citizen, Alice keeps the private key private and the public key public, right? Alice writes the message, uses\\nthe private key to sign it, sends it over to to Bob, Bob then pulls the public key and verifies the message using the public key,\\ndecrypts using the public key. And that will prove that\\nit came from Alice, right? The public key will decrypt a message and we know it came from her. So let\\'s get onto identity. We can think of this like a\\npassport office a little bit. Like I don\\'t wanna carry\\nmy birth certificate and my, you know, utility\\nbill around everywhere. So I take it to one agency, they give me a standardized document that I can present at many places, right? So that\\'s my passport. We\\'re gonna use this analogy\\na couple times in this talk. So, you know, I come along\\nwith my papers, right? Or I come in with my\\nusername and password, I prove my identity, I get back a passport or the token, right,\\nthat I can use to show that I am who I say I am to any passport office, you know, or border control agent\\nin the world, right? So that\\'s a standard document, the power of that standard document. The problem is that that\\nstandard document can be fake, it can be forged, right? So I want to find some way\\nto make sure that you know that this is a legitimate\\npassport coming in from a legitimate passport office. And the way we would do that\\nin a passport world is we have a hologram on the passport, and all the border control\\nagents know there\\'s a document they can look at that tells them, these are the valid pictures, these are what the\\nholograms should look like, and here\\'s how you test it\\nwith a pen or whatever, right? So the equivalent for this is an identity is we\\'re gonna use public\\nkey cryptography, right? So an identity provider has a\\npublic key and a private key. They need to keep the private key safe, they need to publish\\nthe public key, right? Going back through the same ritual again, I prove my identity, this time when I get my\\npassport or my token, I sign it, right? The signed token now can be presented to the border control agent\\nwho can use the public key to verify that it\\'s a\\nlegitimate passport or token. So far so good? Alright? Okay, now I\\'m gonna\\nstart this joke, which is that there are things in life where the answer is one more, right? How many bikes is the\\nright number of bikes? One more. How many guitars? One more, right? And in this case, how\\nmany identity providers? One more, right? So we had two at this\\npoint in time in 2016, we had two distinct systems. I am long enough at Microsoft to have some culpability in\\nthe fact that we have two, I said, \"This will be trouble,\" and sure enough. And so the thing that we\\nhave is Enterprise system that serves things like Azure\\nand you know, Microsoft 365 and Dynamics, right? And then we have in 2016\\nthe consumer system, which is on the top there and it does things like Xbox and Skype and \"Minecraft\" and that sort of thing. And for this story, the\\nones that really matter here are outlook.com, which is the\\nconsumer facing mail system and OWA, outlook web access, which is the Enterprise\\nfacing mail system. So in 2016, we have two of these things. Now, OWA has extensibility points. And the extensibility points here allow it to do some of the things, we\\'re gonna talk about that in a second. But the other thing to\\nknow here is that the part where we went and we got the public key, and we used the public key to verify that we were dealing\\nwith a legitimate token, we had a library to help with that called shockingly something\\nlike verify token, right? And that library was in use\\nby both outlook.com and OWA. And so its whole job was go\\nup to the public key site, get the public key, make sure\\nthat the token signature works with the public key. OWA has these extension points to interact with the extension points, they wanna be able to\\nprovide functionality for either on-premises\\nservers or cloud capabilities. So you can think of like if\\nyou were doing, you know, mime or you know, other kind\\nof functions like that. And so for those functions to work across both\\non-premises environments and the cloud environments, they had to do token normalization. They might get a token\\nfrom an a DFS server, they might get a token from\\nus from us, from Entra. And so to do that, what\\nthey would do is this, they would exchange the token\\nthat we provided, right? So you can think about\\nexchanging my passport for maybe a visa, right? And they would hand back to the client or to the user agent and OWA token, okay? And we\\'ll get close enough to\\nthe machine for it to animate. There we go. And then the user agent from that point on to interact with OWA, would actually pass the OWA\\ntoken, not the Entra token. All right, like I said, one\\nmore is the right answer. Okay, so we have three IDPs\\nin play with these libraries, let\\'s add one more thing to the puzzle. We have a bunch of people\\nin 2016 who are like, \"I\\'m a consumer person only, consumers are one thing and Enterprise is another thing and never the two shall meet, right?\" But what we see is things like GitHub, where you have a high school\\nstudent who\\'s writing code, checking in that code, and then having a teacher\\ngrade that code, right? And that interaction is, I\\'m\\nusing my personal account, my personal consumer account\\nto check in the code, and then I\\'m using my\\norganizational school account to read the code, right? So we have more and more applications as we kind of get richer in identity and more cloud services that need to interact with individuals, maybe I\\'m an individual consultant, I have a little like design studio and I\\'m doing artwork\\nfor your business, right? So those kinds of interactions\\nbecome more popular and more common and developers ask us, \"Hey, make this thing easier.\" So we create this thing called\\nthe Common Endpoint, right? And the Common Endpoint basically\\npublishes the public keys for both services into one\\ncombined endpoint, okay? So that is identity from about\\n2018 to 2023 at Microsoft, you know, at a high level. All right, other things\\nthat were going on in terms of setting the stage, attacks are getting worse, they\\nare getting more aggressive, there is more compute\\navailable to attackers, they\\'re getting more innovative, and the collaboration technologies\\nwe have are being used by attackers to level up attacks. That\\'s playing out in\\nidentity specifically where we\\'re seeing kinda\\nthis ratcheting up of attacks where, you know, as\\npeople move towards MFA, we start defeating MFA, as we move towards phishing-resistant,\\nwe start doing token theft, and then finally, we see things\\nlike the SolarWinds attack in 2020, which is an attack\\non infrastructure, right? Where we\\'re actually trying\\nto get after the a DFS keys or compromised the servers. And a lot of persistence there, especially by advanced\\npersistent threat actors. And nation-state\\nnotifications are plentiful and we see more attacks by\\nnation-state affiliated groups that are highly funded\\nand highly persistent. So that\\'s our pre-stage or\\npre-attack stage, right? We have these three identity providers, we have the common publishing endpoint, we have the validation libraries,\\nand then we have advanced and ongoing attacks on\\ninfrastructure are on the rise. So let\\'s meet the players. The first player we\\'re\\ngonna talk about is our, you know, misspent youth,\\nright, is Storm-O558. Storm-O558 is a China-based threat actor, which operates primarily in United States, Western Europe and Southeast Asia, and has particular interests in doing things that are\\nrelated to diplomatic, economic, legislative activity, right? So that\\'s who these guys are. We\\'ve been tracking them under that name since about 2021, okay? We have interesting things\\nthat give us indications of where they\\'re based and that includes some of the stuff I\\'ll\\ntell you about later. But we have high confidence\\nthat they\\'re based in China. We have, you think about, you know, we\\'re committing a bank robbery, I want this the special gem\\nor you know, phyto token or whatever it is that\\'s\\nin the vault, right? But the vault is in a bank,\\nand so we\\'re the bank, right? We\\'re the ground upon which\\nthe attack is committed, which the crime is committed. And so Entra provides\\naccess to these things and the treasures are\\nheld in exchange, right? This is what these guys\\nas espionage people want is the mail communications. We have a bunch of people\\nwho are the defenders, right? And so I guess you could imagine the scene and the crime movie where\\nlike the FBI officer shows up and starts talking to the\\nlocal police or whatever. You know, we too have multiple\\ndefender organizations, we collaborate very heavily. I\\'m wearing in solidarity\\nwith my friends in DART, the DART logo from a while back. The DART team basically focuses on direct on-premises\\nresponse with customers, the MYSTIC team is the team that primarily works on attribution and threat intelligence\\nfor persistent actors and each of these will play a big role. We have security teams in most\\nof the product organizations, including M365. And so there\\'s a team that\\'s specialized in\\ndoing exchange security. And then the team that I run is IDFIRE and we do the identity centric hunting, it\\'s forensics incident response\\nand eviction for Microsoft and it\\'s a busy group of people. One of the founders of that\\nteam is sitting right there. So it\\'s kind of cool to see Dana here. And then we have our victim, right? And the victim is an organization that I think it\\'s pretty public who it is. I won\\'t name them just by\\nhabit, I don\\'t name people. But they have built a\\ndedicated detection algorithm and that algorithm is running\\noff of mail items accessed. And so they have this\\nvery special detection that they\\'re running. And the reason for that\\nis they were impacted by the SolarWinds attack, they were one of the organizations\\nthat were hit by that and they had developed a great deal of sensitivity to mail exfiltration, so they had done some custom detections. With all that set, we can\\nnow get onto the crime scene. So what happens? Well, I\\'m gonna tell the\\nstory kind of from, you know, the lens that I can tell it\\nfrom, which is mine, right? How I experienced or how\\nmy team experienced it. And so you might get a\\nslightly different, you know, the tour of this from a different team. But what happens is on June 15th, the detection that the company or the organization had built lights up, it detects anomalous activity. And that is resulting\\nfrom the analysis of logs that are coming from mail items accessed, and specifically these exchange logs that are in the universal audit logs. And it includes this data plus, you know, forensics about how they expect people to work in their organization, right? They\\'d had some false positives before. So they took a little bit of time to make sure this wasn\\'t a false positive. They decided it was not a false positive, and on June 16th, they called in DART. DART\\'s again the local response team. Now we have a close working relationship with this organization. So, you know, it\\'s kinda a hotline. DART gets involved, they gather forensic\\ninformation from the attack, you know, looking at the logs and the detections that had happened and they passed the word to MYSTIC because MYSTIC again is\\npersistent threat actors. And because of who the organization is and previous engagements, we think we need to be looking for whether we have a persistent\\nthreat actor involved here. So at that point, MYSTIC gets the data and MYSTIC does their magic\\nkind of on an ongoing basis. So as they track these threat actors, they\\'re looking for different indicators, you know, techniques\\nand practices and IOCs that tell us kind of who they are and where they are and what\\nthey\\'re doing now, right? Once we latch onto one of\\nthese people, we\\'re trying to make sure we stay with them. And one of the ways that\\nMYSTIC stays with this group is that they\\'re looking at\\nthe VPN infrastructure that the actor uses. And the actor uses things and\\nthey have in their playbook, their tool book, and they set things up\\nin a pretty specific way. You\\'ll see the little orange sign there with the Storm-0558 blog. That blog publishes all the\\nIOCs and TTPs that we gathered and how to hunt for this, and we\\'ll go into detail\\nhere if you want to, probably not, in the next 40 minutes, but later go and look at the blog, you can learn about all this stuff. But what\\'s important here is\\nthat we were tracking nodes. We can watch nodes light up on this VPN and know it was them, right? And we can watch \\'em go out. And this will become important as we go through in time, right? So we have a set of IP addresses that we know are actor\\naffiliated IP addresses. So as soon as MYSTIC gets this\\ninformation, they\\'re like, \"Hey, that\\'s Storm-0558.\" They know for sure. Now you could ask this question, \"Well why didn\\'t you watch for it ahead of time and be proactive?\" And the answer is, we did, but not this deep in the system, right? We looked at the authentication\\ntraffic going to exchange, not the inside, you know, there\\'s only\\nso much you need to watch or you think you need to watch, right? And so the logging that\\nwas being watched was the intro logging, not the\\nexchange logging, right? As soon as they see this though, they say, \"Oh, you know, we missed a source.\" So they got the data\\nfrom the exchange team and they went and they\\nidentified 21 more targets, okay? So we now have 22 organizations\\nthat have been impacted, MYSTIC and DART begin the\\nprocess of engaging with CISA and, you know, other law enforcement and notifying all the agencies, it\\'s called NSN,\\nNation-State Notification, where we have advanced persistent\\nthreat actor engagement. So what happens over the next 10 days is that we look at the investigation in kind of a, boy, that\\'s a\\nbummer that that happened. somebody has malware, like\\nclearly we have token theft \\'cause we know their\\nauthentication wouldn\\'t allow for password stealing, but somebody\\'s got malware,\\nthere\\'s been token theft, or there\\'s an insider attacker, right? Kind of this is what we see\\nevery day, day in, day out, it\\'s super common attack pattern, so this is kinda the assumption\\nis we have a local problem. The exchange team, so the DART team\\'s on premises trying to figure out who\\'s got the\\nmalware, who\\'s the insider, what\\'s going on, where\\ndid the token, you know, where did the access come from, right? On the other side, on the exchange side, they\\'re looking through and saying, \"Okay, do we have any\\nother actor activity? Do we have anybody else using\\nthe same pattern of attack? You know, what\\'s going on here?\" And what we\\'re not seeing\\nis the middle part, which is the Entra traffic, right? But that\\'s, you know,\\neverybody\\'s busy like, and we\\'re doing this big burn and we\\'re figuring out what they\\'re doing and analyzing the traffic patterns. And then we have, you know,\\nthis sort of nice breakthrough on the 25thand we are\\npuzzled and thinking, \"This must be an authentication that happened a long time ago and it\\'s faded from the logs or the actor or we had a log failure because logging at high volume can be lost, right?\" And so we have a failure,\\nwe\\'ve just lost the traffic. But then we see this, on the 25th, the actor spins up a node, installs our software on it and\\nforgets to secure it, right? So typically what we see is we can say, \"Oh, here\\'s the basic tell of what operating system\\nthey\\'re using, right, as far as the response we\\'re\\ngetting back from these nodes.\" But in this particular case, it\\'s like, and the door is wide open,\\nit\\'s a public website, right? So at that point, we go\\nand we download the data from the actor, right? And we pull their source\\ncode off that node, alright? And we have, inside of that,\\nwe have this magic tell, which is that we can see the\\ncode that they\\'re calling, the APIs that they\\'re calling, right? And they\\'re calling into this thing called\\nGetAccessTokensForResource. And the way that the system\\nstacks up in terms of the calls that are going back and forth\\nbetween OWA and the client, and then back in, again, we have that\\ndedicated normalized token for exchange, right? And this is a call that is\\nused, we think internally, but turns out the actor\\ncould call it, right? And by calling it, they\\'re getting and refreshing these tokens. They\\'re bypassing the OWA refresh point. So OWA has a token refresh control and they\\'re bypassing it. So we\\'re thinking, \"Oh, this\\nmust be a really old token,\" right, let\\'s turn that off, right?\" That\\'s what happens. So we stop accepting tokens\\nat that point, right? We take immediate action, we\\npush a hot fix and we say, \"We\\'re not gonna accept this\\nexchange anymore, right? You\\'re gonna have to come back\\nto Entra for your tokens.\" So we push that and immediately we start\\nseeing actor-generated tokens. And the actor-generated\\ntokens have many things that are weird about them. And the same day that we start seeing\\nthose tokens coming in, which is the 27th, we get the call on the\\nidentity side, which is, \"Hey, we think we have a problem,\\nplease come look at this.\" And this is one of these like\\ngoing back through my notes and having PTSD moments, like the moment that I saw this, right? You see this and you\\'re like, \"We may have a (indistinct) in here. We may have lost our\\nprivate key here, right?\" It is one of two things I\\nhad hoped I would retire before they happened, the\\nsecond hasn\\'t happened yet. I won\\'t even mention it, but this is like the second\\nworst that can happen to an identity system. And so at this point, we look at things that we will over the next\\ncouple of days confirm are true, but you\\'ll see that I have\\nthis Enterprise passport. I\\'m going to Enterprise\\nland, I\\'m going to, you know, org land, but I\\'m stamped\\nwith a consumer stamp, right? So to try to get the\\nanalogy across for you and the consumer stamp is really old, it\\'s stated back in 2016. So it\\'s an out of use\\nconsumer stamp, right? And there\\'s subtle tales throughout this that are just wrong, right? One of which is that we use a special identification sequence, it\\'s subtle and I\\'m not\\ngonna talk about it now, but the way we stamp our\\nsession IDs is unique and we do that on purpose. And guess what? It didn\\'t match our pattern, right? So everything about\\nthis is starting to say, \"Hey, this is a forged token,\" which means we have a stolen key, right? So at that point we pull the alarm bell and we start what\\'s at Microsoft we call the standardized security incident response protocol, and we do a Sev Zero serp, which basically means\\nit\\'s all hands on deck. Anybody who can do\\nanything with log analysis or help with security analysis in any way, this is top priority, for every engineering team\\ninvolved, it\\'s top priority. And we spend the next couple of days running two things in parallel. One is confirming the hypothesis\\nthat we have a forged token and therefore a key that\\'s been egressed, and the other is responding\\nessentially as though we do and then, you know, running\\nthose things in parallel. So this is, you know, a frenetic week. One of the things we do just\\nproactively same day as we say, \"Let\\'s roll the key right now,\\nget that key outta rotation, the key that we saw\\nassociated with the token.\" So we do that, this is my version, and the thing to point out is the way that you roll the key is\\nyou issue a new key, right? So we roll a new key, we get\\nthe old key out of rotation. We actually did this a couple of times and we also rolled\\nEnterprise keys as well. I\\'m not gonna talk about that here, but you know, we were shooting things just, you know, round\\ntripping it basically. The second thing we did is\\nwe said, \"Wait a minute, why can I accept an\\nEnterprise claim that\\'s signed by a consumer token? That shouldn\\'t be, it\\'s IDP1 and IDB2 and I\\'m accepting claims\\nfrom IDP2 signed by IDP1, that doesn\\'t make sense. So what\\'s going wrong here?\" What we identified was that that library, which is validate token, right? That library pre-existed\\nthe shared endpoint, when the shared point endpoint went up, it went up with metadata that\\nsaid, \"Here is the scoping and the correct use of this endpoint,\" that was available data, but it wasn\\'t built into the library. So the people who were consuming the library reasonably assumed that we would update the library so that it would work with\\nthe new endpoint, right? In this case, the people being the exchange developers, right, but we hadn\\'t. And so they said, \"Well, we\\'re gonna use\\nthe new common endpoint, we\\'re going to assume\\nthat the library is fine,\" and it wasn\\'t. And so what that allowed\\nus to do is to go up to, remember the library\\'s job is simple, go up to the billboard,\\npull the public keys, and if anything will\\nvalidate this message, then the message is valid, right? So the attacker is creating\\nEnterprise claims, signing up with the consumer key, the\\nvalidation library is using the common endpoint is not\\ndifferentiating the two things and it\\'s saying, You\\'re good to go.\" Right, so that\\'s why exchange is accepting these claims coming\\nfrom the Enterprise set. All right, so we update the libraries, this is later, right,\\nthis is outta the blog, but we update the two libraries publicly as well as privately and we roll that out\\nacross the organization. Exchange puts in their own checking. And then the next week in\\nterms of an analysis, you know, lots of craziness is going on. We analyze relying party logs for all the Microsoft services. So we offer a lot of services\\nand there\\'s a lot of logs. And so this is a serious burn, like, this is around\\nthe clock Sev Zero serp, which means that there\\'s\\nno downtime, right? We\\'re rotating people off, they\\nsleep, they get back online, we go from country to country\\nkeeping this stuff going. And we\\'re looking for any\\nsign of the thumbprint for this thing or any sign\\nof the actor activity. So the indicators of compromise traffic from these endpoints. And we go through all the\\nlogs that we have, right? And we do not find any more activity outside of the mail system. We do find 502 consumer accounts\\nthat have been impacted. Those consumer accounts all track back to the organizations that were impacted. So it\\'s, for example, if\\nI have the investigator from Team X, I\\'ve got their personal account or maybe somebody in their\\nfamily\\'s personal account, but they were all correlated,\\nthey all correlated back. So we do the notifications for that. So we add more notification\\ntraffic where we tell the people that they\\'re impacted and we find no other evidence\\nof the use of the key. Also, I mean we realize\\nthe dates are still tight, like, we figured out the\\nkey was forged on the 27th, we\\'re still talking about the 27th, right? So things are happening really fast. OWA, once we realized the\\nproblem with this offending key, two changes are made. One is to not accept consumer keys at all, and then one is to explicitly\\ndisallow use of that key. So any token issued that rooted back to that key is banned\\nin the OS system, right? At that point, all the actor traffic in the exchange mail system stops, and the same day, the actor\\nswitches back to phishing \\'cause they have a mission to accomplish and they\\'re gonna do it\\nhowever they need to do it. So they go right back to, you know, adversary in the middle of\\nphishing techniques, right? On the 29th, the public key rotation, which we had started on the 27th, completes this worldwide propagation. So remember we\\'re not\\ndoing things in one place and we have lots and lots of services, they all have to refresh, right? So all the services have picked up, we validate that on the 29th. We also do the same trick\\nin outlook as we did in OWA. And by the third that that change has been propagated worldwide, which is that that key\\nis explicitly banned and we have notifications going if we see any instances of it. Now, it\\'s kind of worth noting that the key we\\'re talking\\nabout was in backup or old role. So nobody from Microsoft\\nwas signing with this key. So this thumbprint was\\nvery, very evident to us. It wasn\\'t like we had\\nto figure out, you know, was this one legitimate or not? If it was signed with\\nthis key, it was bad, \\'cause we were not in our\\nsystems using this key at all. July 3rd, we\\'re done,\\nall activity is stopped. And at this point we can\\nkind of imagine that like, you know, the police are on scene and you have the wet parking\\nlot with the rain falling and the, you know, right? So that\\'s where we are in\\nour crime story right now. So let\\'s talk about what happened, right? So this is the full\\nmechanics of the attack. The first thing that happens is the actor acquires the\\nconsumer signing key. We\\'ll talk about that\\nnext, don\\'t worry. Okay? The second thing that happens is they forge an Enterprise token using the consumer signing key. They call an essentially internal endpoint to exchange the token for an OWA token. They go use the OWA token to get mail and then when they need\\nto refresh their token, they bypass the normal OWA refresh and they keep the token alive\\nusing the alternate mechanism. So that\\'s what they\\'re doing, that\\'s how the attack starts before we start interacting\\nwith them, right? And then, you know, basically\\nfrom the time we detected it and understood it on the 26th to the 27th, that was shut down. So the attack left goalpost is May 15th. We know that because we have\\ntheir actor infrastructure, we have their source code, right? The right goalpost is the 27th. I\\'m sorry I\\'m using what\\nI\\'m assuming are terms that we sort of know, but I\\nget scolded from time to time from using security geek terms, left goalpost when it started, right goalpost when it stopped. Okay, so hypothetically this\\nkey could have been used to forge tokens for any consumer service. Storm-0558 could have played your \"Minecraft\" game if\\nthey\\'d wanted to, right? They could have read your personal mail, they could have played your Xbox, right? They could have, depending on the service, they could have read\\ndata from other services, Microsoft services and other services that trust Microsoft Keys, right? Anybody who had this validation\\nerror for this endpoint and use the endpoint could\\nhave been vulnerable, right? So the hypothetical impact is huge. And this is like saying, \"I have a brick, I can rob any house in America,\" and that\\'s true, I can break a window, I can take a TV, right? In practice, however, you don\\'t because you don\\'t want\\nyour brick taken away and you only have so\\nmany hours in the day. So you target your attacks and this is an attacker that\\nwe know what they like, right? They had an objective, they had an attack objective,\\nthey had a powerful tool, they knew they had a powerful tool, they didn\\'t wanna get\\ncaught using the tool. They used it because they\\nhad a specific objective and when they used it, fortunately, the first person that we\\nheard from detected it, which was a big deal. So what do we have that\\ngives us some confidence that the scope is what\\nwe say the scope is? Well, first of all, I wanna be clear, we can\\'t prove a negative, like\\naliens could have abducted, you know, data or whatever,\\nlike we can\\'t say for sure. But what we can say is that\\nmail for 22 organizations of 502 consumers confirm by\\nmonitoring of their traffic and their infrastructure by MYSTIC and monitoring the actual traffic that\\'s coming in from those IP nodes, reviewing all the logs, or capture of the actor source code, correlation to previous\\nobservations of the actor and the fact that they\\nwent back to phishing as soon as we rolled the keys. So those are all the things\\nthat give us some confidence that we have some understanding of the scope of the attack. Alright, so having cleaned that up, we published two blogs related to activity and those were essentially\\ntelling you all the stuff I\\'ve told you using maybe different words, maybe a little bit less color on how the investigation\\nteam\\'s experienced it, but again, those are all\\navailable to you at Storm-0558. And then we start the thing\\nthat\\'s really hard, right, is how\\'d they get the key? And I want to be very clear, this is an ongoing investigation, right? We are not done trying to find out, we may never find out and I\\'ll\\nexplain to you why that is, but this is an ongoing investigation as to how the key was acquired by the actor. And I\\'ll give you kind of our\\nbest understanding right now. When the attack happened, obviously is an incredible priority for the company to figure\\nout what happened, right? So we have red teams, we have,\\nyou know, pen test teams, we have all kinds of\\ndifferent people from all over the company, jumping in to try to help us figure it out. And we started with kinda\\ngetting a brain trust together of the architects for\\nidentity, the architects for, you know, cryptography, and like what are all the\\nthings that could have happened? And we come up with essentially\\n46 hypotheses, right? And these ranged from, was the person in this\\noperational role an insider? You know, does this actor have\\naccess to a quantum cluster that we\\'re not aware exists yet\\nand did they reduce the key? Were there problems with\\nthe issuance process, right? Like, could it have been\\npossible for the workstation the key was being generated on to have crashed in the\\nmiddle of that process and could that have caused a problem. Could the nodes that the\\nkey is used by have crashed and exposed the memory\\nthat the key was in, right? So these are all these\\nquestions we\\'re asking. For each of these hypotheses,\\nwe started three work streams. One was investigate, go\\nprove that it happened, the second one was detect, go prove you would know if it happened. The third one was prevent, go prove that it could\\nnot happen today, right? Detection and prevention\\nare relatively easy because they\\'re against\\ncurrent day systems, right? So you can say, \"In the current system, I have built this detection, right? In the current system\\nI\\'ve got this prevention.\" Because the teams were\\nburning hard on this, we in very many places\\nduplicated our detections, duplicated our prevention. And this is good. This is like solving the\\nsame math problem two ways and getting the same answer, right? We want to have as much redundancy and depth as of defense as we can here, so we added huge amounts of new detection and prevention work covering\\nall of the possible hypotheses that we had. In the process of that and investigation, we also identified some\\nthings that were impossible. So You can probably take this\\nhypothesis off the table, it just wasn\\'t possible. There\\'s others like the\\nreduction of the key that we can\\'t prove, well, we\\'ll never really know\\nwhether the attacker reduced the key from a public key. We think it\\'s extremely unlikely because had you the choice of keys to use, this is the key you would\\'ve\\nchosen not to use, right? It\\'s the wrong key for the scope, and in this expired key,\\nit sticks out, right? And so you wouldn\\'t want to use this if you\\'re trying to avoid detection. So we didn\\'t think that quantum was likely because we think if they had, you know, the quantum reduction for example, they would\\'ve reduced the\\ncurrent Enterprise key not an old consumer key. But when you look at this, you know, we got all these new capabilities, we eliminated some traffic, but investigations path is harder. The investigations path is hard because the systems are in\\nconstant evolution, right? We run red team attacks,\\nwe do bounty programs, we do pen tests, we do\\nsecurity evaluations, and we find things and we fix them on an ongoing basis, right? So we\\'re constantly investing\\nin the security of the system. The 2016 consumer system\\nis basically nothing like the 2023 Enterprise system, and it\\'s not like it was\\njust that system, it was that system in every evolution\\nit went through, right? So we can go back and we\\ncan look at, for example, what are the fixes we took\\nin the consumer system in that period of time to go find out what were the vulnerabilities\\nwe worried about in each of those moments\\nand what were the things that were possible hypothesis, right, that helped form our hypothesis. As we went and looked\\nthrough this, the things that evolved as the most likely, and I wanna be very clear,\\nthis is the hypothesis, it is the most likely hypothesis, it is not a statement of\\nhow it happened, right? The most likely hypothesis\\nbecame that operational failures around the kind of key creation were the most likely explanation for how the key escaped\\nsecure containment. So the key should never leave the secure signing system, right? We don\\'t ever want to see\\nit outta that environment, it\\'s gotta be in the safe. The most likely explanation is that we had some sort of operational failure due to limitations of that\\nsystem at that time, right? And so for example, Managed HSM did not exist in 2016, right? We did not have confidential\\ncompute in 2016, right? These are technologies that\\njust didn\\'t exist yet, right? We also had a fairly\\nmanual process in 2016. Our primary concern in, you know, in the early days of the\\nconsumer systems were that we would have\\nsomebody reduce the key. So key rotation was based\\non the expected time it would take to reduce a key, right? And so, you know, the long key lifetimes. In 2021, a couple of things happen, but one of them is this reentry or you know, entry into our environment, into the environment by Storm-0558, right? So we think that in 2016, around the time of key creation is the\\nmost likely explanation for when we lost the key from containment when it got out of the\\nsecure signing environment, most likely through operational failures. One possibility for that is that the system crashed, captured the key in plain text in memory, and the crash dump was exfiltrated by a developer with good intent. That\\'s just a hypothesis, we showed to ourselves that\\nthat was a possible hypothesis because we found a race\\ncondition in the configuration for our systems, which disable crash dumps for exactly this reason. But it was possible for\\nthe platform configuration to be run after our overrides. So it was just a sequencing\\nproblem at boot time and it was possible that the system\\nconfiguration would come in after our particular configuration, right? And so we fixed that, but that would\\'ve allowed\\ncrash dumps to happen. We found adjacent material\\nfor each of these hypotheses. We never found a plain\\ntext key in our system. We looked exhaustively for it. But that key, if it did escape the secure signing environment\\ndid not just appear in 2016 and vanish. It appeared in 2016 and\\nprobably went into a database or into a file or into a mail or, you know, who knows, right? Like it got into the environment, and from that point on, you know, did somebody take a backup of it? We like, we don\\'t know. But once it\\'s outside of the\\nsecure signing environment, the opportunities are broad, right? Once it\\'s lost from that\\nsecure signing environment, we have this broad opportunity. So Storm-0558 reenters\\nour environment in 2021. I say reenters, I\\'m\\nsaying that incorrectly. They enter our environment in 2021 to our knowledge, first time, right? And they do this using malware. They get a token from a device and they managed to get a bunch of files. And the files they\\'re looking for are specific to identity systems. So if the key were in\\nthe broader, you know, engineering environment for identity, if it was there because\\nsomebody had attached it to a database or whatever,\\npassed it to somebody for help evaluating it, not by itself, but as part of a crash dump or as part of a other body of work, right? Then that key could have been exfiltrated by the actor that time. So this forms our most likely hypothesis, key egresses in 2016 due\\nto operational failure, key is picked up by the actor in 2021. Why aren\\'t we sure? Why didn\\'t we find it? Because we\\'re constantly also\\nbuilding more credit scanning and more cleaning processes, and developers make a mistake, we automatically correct\\nthat mistake for them. If they check in, you\\nknow, a certificate as part of their code check-in, we\\nwipe the certificate, right? Or we block the check\\nin and change the data. So we have these sweeper processes and the sweeper processes\\nare constantly going through the environment and they\\'re constantly getting better. So the sweeper that missed the\\nkey in 2017 might\\'ve caught the key in 2022, making the\\ninvestigation even harder. Like, we\\'re literally removing this data and logs aren\\'t retained forever, so some of the older logs are gone. This is why I say we\\nmay never know, right? We may never actually be able to land it. We did very heavy investigation, but this combination of\\ncontinuous improvement and evolution of the system\\nand continuous sweeping and cleaning of the system to\\nharden the system is actually making this investigation harder to do \\'cause of the latency here. So in September 6th, we thought, \"Okay, we\\'ve exhausted all of the logs, we\\'re not finding anything else.\" And you know, we had this very\\nstrong conversations about, and very clearly on, you\\nknow, the side of like, let\\'s publish, let\\'s tell\\npeople where we\\'re at, let\\'s tell \\'em what I\\njust told you, right? And so we wrote a blog that explained what we believed was\\nthe truth at the time. Like we said, \"We\\'ve done\\nthese investigations, this is what we found. There\\'s one material\\nmistake in the block.\" We said we had a crash dump\\nwith the key, we did not. That\\'s the material thing that changes. However, it doesn\\'t change\\nthe scope of impact, it doesn\\'t change the\\nguidance to customers, right? It doesn\\'t change anything\\nabout the material hypothesis about what went wrong in the system or what we\\'ve done to fix it. And for those reasons, we thought we had a discussion\\nabout when to update. And the discussion was let\\'s update when we have a complete conclusion because we\\'ve opened other lines of investigation now, and the idea was like, \"Let\\'s update when we have\\na complete conclusion.\" We talked about all this with CSRB and you know, when we knew they\\nwere gonna publish, we said, \"Well, we better make sure\\npeople understand that that line was materially incorrect.\" So we updated the blog on March 12th. The response here has been noisy, I think in the press\\nwe obviously, you know, have been responding continuously to advanced persistent\\nthreat actors for years and have been ramping up. We have, I think, a new level\\nof response at this point, and the response here is really, you know, in this very nice mail from Friday that Satya sent to every\\nemployee at Microsoft. Very simple, if you have a trade off, do the security thing first, right? So this is the secure future initiative. There\\'s been a fair amount of press on it. And so I\\'m not gonna talk\\nabout it in a huge amount of depth, but I think\\nthis is the, you know, the most important thing is that there is a fundamental\\nshift in the way that we are, you know, thinking about\\nsecurity ass just unambiguously there\\'s not like, \"Well,\\nthis is a smaller issue, like just fix the security stuff and then the rest can go on.\" So from the perspective\\nof the security teams, of course that\\'s huge empowerment. Secure by design, Secure by\\ndefault, Secure operations. Kind of the things that\\nare important in terms of the thematics, we\\'re\\ndoing pave path systems. So we\\'ve done a bunch of\\nwork like security defaults and managed policies to try to make your life easier in terms of rolling out multifactor\\nauth or pass keys or whatever. Think about from a\\ndeveloper\\'s perspective, the easiest thing to do\\nis what they\\'re gonna do. Make sure that\\'s an\\nabsolutely secure thing that we can actually\\nupdate as we go, right? So, you know, communalizing\\nand securing systems and making them really easy,\\nthat easy part\\'s important. If you give people high friction, high security things,\\nthey\\'ll find low friction, low security things to do, right? We\\'re not done. We\\'ve talked about SFI in November, we\\'re talking about it again now, we\\'ll talk about it again later, I\\'m sure we will learn more and do more. You know, we\\'re a learning\\nculture so I think, you know, continuous improvement is part of it. There are six major pillars. Lots of them track to what\\nI\\'ve been talking about here. The one I wanna talk about just briefly is on identities and secrets. The work we\\'re doing here\\naround moving keys to HSM, we\\'re starting to move\\nto state full tokens, which basically means\\nevery time you get a token, you call the token introspection endpoint and you say, \"Hey, is this okay?\" It reduces your reliance on key material that also gives you better\\nrealtime reaction speeds. Common libraries across the board so people can\\'t make validation errors, keeping those libraries current, the movement to secure memory management, like Confidential Compute and Managed HSM so that the keys just\\ncan\\'t be exfiltrated. We already have done full automation of the key management process, so we\\'ve removed human\\nerror from this equation. So this is all the kinds of stuff that we\\'re doing in response and ongoing long running response. If you\\'re waiting for identity features, you may be waiting slightly longer. If you\\'re waiting for any features, you may be waiting slightly longer, right? But the net effect is\\nessentially snapping everything to current standards and\\nthen keeping it there. And then the sort of the\\nmoral of the story is this, I think that, I get this question a lot, which is, \"Hey, how do you feel about the report?\" And I think that the response was exactly the right response, which\\nis, let\\'s lean into it. What can we learn from it, right? So we went and, you know,\\ndo you want to testify? Yeah, we, do. \\'Cause we believe strongly\\nthat we can\\'t stand in isolated silos as an industry\\nand withstand attacks by, you know, nation-states or nation-state affiliated organizations. Like, we\\'re not gonna succeed, right? We\\'ll get off one by one. So the key here is how do we stand shoulder\\nto shoulder better? And in the industry, the\\nway we do that is we go, \"Hey, this happened.\" You know, like that\\'s the\\npoint of this talk, right? You can learn, you know,\\nhow did we experience it? What were the things that led to this? Charlie said recently, he says, you know, \"Every accident, every\\nfailure is preventable, right? Every accident is the sum of\\na set of parallel failures.\" So you know, you can look\\nat the parallel failures in the situation. If we study those, and I think what the\\nCSRB is trying to do is to study these things and like the NTSB, get to\\na place where we can say, \"Hey, the whole industry can implement what we learned from these things.\" So when I was asked just recently, like, \"How do you feel about that report?\" I was like, \"It\\'s fuel, man, it\\'s great. We\\'re gonna push ourselves harder, we\\'re gonna learn more, right?\" So we\\'re enthusiastic\\nparticipants in the report, we\\'re enthusiastic, frankly, about leaning into the recommendations to the report and more, and the growth mindset here, this is not an admonition to you, it\\'s a reminder for us, right? We believe in the growth\\nmindset at Microsoft, and this is an opportunity\\nfor us at Microsoft to lean into that growth mindset and say, \"Okay, what can we learn,\\nyou know, from the event? What can we learn from\\nthe recommendations? What can we learn from the industries, you know, it\\'s essentially\\ntriangulation of that data.\" And so I think that\\'s the\\nmoral of the story, right? If we stand together and we can share data and we can be unafraid to\\nshow where things happened, then we can get better as an industry, we have a better chance of resisting these really,\\nreally well-funded, really persistent attackers. And with that, I think I\\nwill say thank you very much for your time and hope\\nyou guys have a great rest of your conference and journey home also. (audience applauding) All right, thanks a lot.', 'drive': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dqJp5Tw42vuiAiokNXPXh3uF8IAJmlDi'}, {'url': 'https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2024/decoding%20gen%20z%20cultivating%20cybersecuritys%20next%20vanguard', 'title': \"Decoding Gen Z: Cultivating Cybersecurity's Next Vanguard\", 'date': 'May 09, 2024', 'text': \"Ensuring Gen Z's commitment to cybersecurity is vital in this digital era.

I have a pretty loud voice, so I think you guys are gonna\\nhear me over the testing so I don\\'t think we\\'re\\ngonna have any issues there. I\\'m Jax Scott, I am... Outpost Gray is my YouTube channel and my company that I run on the side. I\\'m actually a VP for Pearson. It\\'s an education company,\\nit\\'s out of the UK. And I recently took the\\njob about two months ago, but one thing before I\\njumped into that position, I was a consultant and I\\nworked with an immense amount of Generation Z individuals and we\\'ll talk about what is a Gen Z. But the point of today\\'s talk\\nis to empower you to be able to create a better communication strategy within your organization\\nthat touches on all ages \\'cause we\\'re gonna start\\nseeing more Gen Zs start coming into the workforce. So little bit disclaimer, you\\nguys have seen this before. My goal today is to educate you all on providing a collaborative\\ncybersecurity community, being able to communicate to all ages, understanding how to really communicate with the younger generation, and then being able to apply it. And I created a little\\nvideo to have a little fun. So laugh if you want. It\\'s okay if you don\\'t. (upbeat music) Well, I appreciate your initiative of locking yourself out\\nof all of your devices. This technique doesn\\'t\\nactually thwart attackers. Next time, I encourage you, reach out to our security team for help. Inform them of the security attack before you lock yourself out. Hey Bob, thanks so much\\nfor meeting with me. This shouldn\\'t take long. I just needed a little bit\\nof clarity on the report that you wrote on the cyber incident. What did you mean when you wrote, \"Cyber attack was fire on my machine?\" Hi Stephanie, I understand you clicked on malware thinking it\\nwas a trend challenge. While I appreciate your\\nengagement and your enthusiasm, let\\'s prioritize security\\nwhile avoiding clicking on unfamiliar links to\\nmitigate potential risks. Jessica, regarding the Hold My\\nFirewall app you downloaded, it\\'s important to stick\\nto recommended software. So let\\'s ensure future downloads come from trusted sources within our company. While I appreciate the\\nversatility of the word \"yeetz\", let\\'s aim for clarity in\\nour next team meeting. Using terms like \"implement\" and \"execute\" ensures everyone\\'s on the same page. Hi Jerry, I see you\\ntweeted about being \"yeet\" with how you handled the cyber attack? Oh my gosh. So that\\'s real life, we\\nsee that all the time. We cannot control what Generation\\nZ are putting out there on the internet, but what\\nwe can do is educate them so they understand the\\nimportance of security. So what is a Gen Z? Gen Z is an age between 1997 to 2012. So 12-year-old to a 27-year-old. The easiest way for me to remember it is they\\'re younger than me, typically. I\\'m actually a millennial, but I\\'m an older millennial. If I\\'ve got any millennials\\nin here, I feel like... (chuckles) Yeah, I feel like we\\'re, most of this room\\'s gonna\\nprobably be millennials and Gen Xs, maybe a couple baby boomers. But the big thing about\\nthe younger generation is they\\'re all about the transparency, having fun, being authentic. And then while they\\'re very\\nliterate with technology, you\\'re gonna see as we go through this, they\\'re actually the\\nmost vulnerable age group that we have right now. So talk about digital\\nfluency and then Gen Z. So when you look at\\nthis graphic right here, if you notice, the technology dimension of the digital fluency is\\nactually only one small portion. It\\'s that top portion right there. Digital foundation, this is where the organization\\nprovides the company with the most up-to-date technology or they\\'re eliminating tech decks. So they\\'re as relevant as possible. But what I want you to\\npay attention to is all of the other three segments, which are actually the\\nworkforce dimensions, part of being digitally fluent. And what we\\'re gonna be focusing on today are the two segments\\non the left-hand side, which is all about digital\\nleadership in the culture. So this is where leadership\\nfrom the top down creates a collaborative culture for cybersecurity, for\\ntechnology, for knowledge sharing. And then the other one is\\na digital workforce TQ. So this right here is all\\nabout the enthusiasm about it with the skill sets,\\nand then driving value, but value that everybody can understand, the value of cybersecurity. \\'Cause if anybody works at\\nthe business unit level, and I have BSOs that work\\nat the business unit level, first thing they wanna do is, \"Why do I have to pay\\nattention to security? \"It\\'s impacting my innovation,\" right? You\\'ve heard that before, \"It\\'s impacting the speed of delivery. \"It\\'s impacting us to go first to market.\" So being able to address all of those will then create digital\\nfluency within your space. This is what I was talking\\nabout a little earlier as far as how vulnerable the Gen\\nZs and the Gen Xs are. So if you actually look,\\nthe younger generation is more likely to send money to the lost prince and be catfished. If we\\'ve all, I don\\'t think those emails are going out anymore, but remember the lost prince of like, \"Send me money\\nto the lost prince?\" Well, if you see right there, Gen Zs, millennials were kind of grouped together. The data has shown that actually, Gen Zs are more vulnerable and it is because they are on the platforms\\nthe majority of the time. So it\\'s like they see a text come in from UPS about a package that\\'s supposed to be delivered to their house, I know you guys have seen that. They automatically just assume that this is a legitimate text message because they\\'re on it all day long, where millennials, maybe\\nthis wasn\\'t something, technology wasn\\'t part of our life until after we got outta\\nhigh school and into college, we\\'re a little bit more reserved. And then the Gen X is definitely reserved. They don\\'t, they don\\'t click on anything. (laughing) I got head shaking over there. They\\'re like, \"Nope, I just,\\nI forward to spam constantly.\" And then you\\'ve got the baby boomers and actually shockingly, baby boomers are slightly less vulnerable than the Gen Z and the millennials. And I think that\\'s honestly, \\'cause my parents are\\nlike in the late seventies and they\\'re just like, \"I\\ndon\\'t know what that is. \"So I\\'m just not gonna click on it.\" I don\\'t really think they\\'re secure. I think they\\'re more of like, \"We don\\'t know what it is, \"we\\'re just not gonna bother with it.\" So beyond the memes, talking about what is, like, Gen Z\\'s values? They\\'re all about the memes and the gifs. Is it \"giffs\" or is it \"jiffs\", question. So the value that they\\'re looking for is all about authenticity. They want to be part of\\nthe social environment. They want to, they agree that digital responsibility\\nis individually led as well as organizationally led. They also are all about\\nprioritizing inclusion and diversity in the online communities. And we\\'re seeing that\\nexternally presented to us. If you guys have seen all of the protests that are happening on the campuses with various different things, they\\'re all about transparency. Another thing is their perspective is that they actually recognize that there\\'s importance to\\nprivacy, and we\\'re seeing that. They want the transparency,\\nbut they also want privacy. They want data protection. They wanna be protected on the internet. But the thing is, is they\\nunderstand there\\'s a risk. They just don\\'t understand the brevity of that risk to themselves,\\nbut even more importantly, to others, especially\\nwithin an organization. They don\\'t understand what that ripple effect\\'s gonna look like if they do click on that text that comes in from UPS about a package that\\'s arrived to their house. They think more it\\'s gonna,\\nthere\\'s a risk to it, but it\\'s just gonna be impacting them versus the collective organization. So there was some research\\nwhen I was going through and not only meeting with my\\nGen Zers and talking to them and actually asking them these questions, but there was also some\\ndata out on the internet that I found very interesting\\non some of the statements that they had said when asked about why they wouldn\\'t engage\\ninto cybersecurity. And these were some of\\nthe things they said. They, one thing was, \"I only\\ndo what\\'s easy and effective.\" I feel like that\\'s not just Gen Z. I feel like that\\'s probably a lot of us, but that really ties into the why. Why are they doing this? But also we need to make security easy. So you can take this talk\\noutside of just Gen Zs and look at if we can make it easy and effective for everyone, more individuals want to be more secure, want to do cybersecurity. The next was, \"I don\\'t feel\\nthat I need to do them all.\" So they felt like, \"Well,\\nif I just quit clicking \"on phishing, I\\'ll be okay. \"Do I have to do all of these things \"that I\\'m being told to do\\nby my cybersecurity team? \"Or can I just do pick and choose? \"Pick and choose a couple of things.\" They don\\'t see that security\\nhas a 360 approach to it. Again, why? It\\'s the why, they\\ndon\\'t understand the why of needing to do all of the factors. And the last one is,\\n\"I just didn\\'t realize \"there were so many\\ncybersecurity behaviors.\" So understanding the complexity of it, and we\\'ll go through some use cases so you can have a better understanding of what they\\'ve done, what\\ncompanies have done to give and drive better understanding\\nto the younger generation to understand the complexity\\nand the different types of cybersecurity behaviors\\nthat are out there. And overall, there was just 60% of the participants didn\\'t have access to cybersecurity training. And that\\'s organizational. It depends, if they\\'re entrepreneurs, a lot of these individuals,\\nif you think about it, they may be entrepreneurs, you may be hiring them into your company as maybe a third party vendor\\nto do your marketing for you, your social media for you,\\ncould be a plethora of things. Making sure that they\\'re\\ndoing and they\\'re taking that cybersecurity training\\nseriously is very important. So how do we inspire action? And there are some things, and\\nI had a dinner two nights ago with some Gen Zs and so we\\'ll\\ntalk about some of the things that they gave me and some suggestions. But one of the big things\\nfor inspiring action is interactive workshops. So we\\'ve all done the\\ncybersecurity training, right? And you just click, click, click. Half the time, I\\'m like, \"Why am I even taking this training?\" It\\'s like Ctrl + F12, put\\nin the code, get to the end. Have you ever done that? Definitely done that in the military. Just get to the end, take the\\nanswers, be done, move on. How many of us actually retain the cybersecurity training that we do? Not many of us, and that\\'s\\nthe same with Gen Zs. You have to think too, when you\\'re trying to\\ncommunicate with them, they\\'re already on information overload. They\\'re on their phones 24/7 and there\\'s actually been a study done that to keep your mind engaged, you need to change the\\nscreen or you need to change, when you\\'re looking at something on, say, YouTube or a TikTok, every\\nthree to five seconds. And what that means is I\\ncould be talking right now, doing a video, but I need to stop and go and stop and go every\\nthree to five seconds. And what that does is\\ndoes a cortisol spike within your mind, within your brain to reengage you every\\nthree to five seconds. Why is that important to know? Because Generation Z, that\\'s\\nall they\\'re doing all day long. They\\'re death scrolling on Instagram, they\\'re death scrolling on TikTok, and they\\'re getting a\\nplethora of information. And now what are we gonna do? Make \\'em sit down in front\\nof a computer for two hours? And they have to hit right, right, right until they can take a test? It\\'s not gonna be effective. It\\'s not effective for most people. And I\\'m a millennial and I\\nhate taking those things. So we\\'ve gotta create and\\nfacilitate hands-on training. This could be workshops that you\\'re doing. This could be intimate. I\\'m doing an intimate\\nworkshop with some new interns that are coming into to Pearson\\nto work for the company. Like, creating a more of a\\nhands-on atmospheric environment so they are more engaging and entertained as they go through it. The next, speaking of entertainment, you all have probably heard\\nabout this, gamified learning. It\\'s a thing that we really\\nneed to start adapting. It\\'s more of an engagement environment. You\\'re gamifying it, so it\\'s, you\\'re making a game out of it. They\\'re gonna enjoy this. Their entire life is technology. And I know that\\'s a hard\\nthing to actually grasp and think about, but that\\'s, they\\'ve literally, from the very youngest, depending on the parents\\nand how young they... I know kids that have\\nphones at nine years old. They have an entire life and identity within technology and\\nit\\'s all types of games. So we need to take what they\\'re used to and we need to be able to\\napply it for cybersecurity. So gamifying it,\\nleveraging different types of cybersecurity games so they can start to learn and take this seriously. And social media campaigns, this goes into being able\\nto utilize influencers to be able to get your mission or your communication strategy out. And why this is important, I talked with, and I was now to fill you\\nin and give you my story about the dinner I had\\na couple of nights ago with a whole bunch of Gen Zs, I asked them, I said,\\n\"Cybersecurity is a challenge. \"You all are entering the workforce, \"yet you don\\'t take cybersecurity\\nas serious as you need to. \"How can we help get you more engaged?\" And across the board at the table, they not only talked about\\ninteractive workshops and gamification, but they\\ntalked about influencers. And Alicia Keys, for example. So Alicia Keys went on\\nand she posted about, and twitted, tweeted, tweeted, Twitter? Twitter, wow that shows my age. I don\\'t even use Twitter. So she tweeted about on\\nTwitter about a social, like, cybersecurity\\nsocial engineering event that was happening, more of these Gen Zs are gonna take it seriously. And I know that\\'s kind of like, \"Ah, why do we have to get influencers \"and social media campaigns on board \"for a communication\\nstrategy,\" and that\\'s kind of, that\\'s outside of your organization. Because you want to engage them, you want to get them on board. It\\'s not gonna work the way that we\\'ve been doing it up to this point. Cybersecurity awareness\\ntraining is not gonna work. So how to keep Gen Zs engaged. Going back into the\\ngamification, creating modules, creating interactive environments for them to be able to engage and see what the impacts are going to be when they click on that phishing email. And understanding,\\n\\'cause what\\'ll happen is when they click on the\\nphishing email, it\\'s not just they\\'re gonna receive an email like you do from your IT department of, \"Hey, this was a phishing email. \"You did not pass this test.\" And then what happens? You gotta go through\\ncybersecurity training. That\\'s not working. So what we\\'ve gotta do\\nis we\\'ve gotta be able to take \\'em into a gamified environment so when they click on\\nit, they can actually see what the outcomes are and then they know what the repercussions\\nare to the organization. Online forums, social media groups, this is a really big area. I don\\'t know how all of\\nyour organizations run, but every organization\\nI typically go into, you have email and then\\nyou have a chat platform. It could be, typically Teams\\nis the one that we utilize, but I know there\\'s others\\nthat organizations use. We need something a\\nlittle bit more than that. If you are gonna use Teams, then create a social media\\nplatform that is fun. Create a hashtag challenge, something like that\\nthat gets them engaged. Give prizes away when somebody\\nidentifies a phishing email. What worked really well\\nin one organization is we had an environment\\nthat when you were able to actually identify a phishing email, you would upload the picture of the phishing email and\\nyou would let us know. And the first person that did that, first person would then get an\\naward, whatever it would be. I mean it could be as simple as a bag of those little gold fishes that you had. Like, play a little fun play\\non words and things like that. But it got people engaged. It got \\'em really wanting\\nto participate in that. Next is, and they\\'re big on this, having a kind of mentorship\\ncollaborative environment. We do this at Pearson\\nwhere we bring interns in and then we have, they have a buddy and then they have a manager\\nthat works with them. And usually the manager is an executive or somebody like that to help\\nguide them in their career. You can do something very\\nsimilar when you\\'re wanting to build out a cybersecurity\\nprogram for these Gen Zs. They want to be mentored. I noticed that at the mentor\\ndinner a couple nights ago, they were like hungry to\\nmeet with individuals. And from my perspective, I\\nfeel like this generation is so intelligent and they want to learn. And I think part of that is because of how connected\\nthey are to the internet versus the other\\ngenerations that we\\'ve seen. And then, I already talked\\na little bit about this, about the teams and doing\\na recognition program, but really establishing a\\nprogram within your organization. The little things go really, really far. And I know that we don\\'t think so, we don\\'t think that giving away a little, you know, influencer stand,\\none of those little lights, they\\'re really honestly like\\n$50 packages, sometimes less. You can send these out. One of my last org did this. They would send us out, it was\\nlike a media kit as an award. So these prizes don\\'t have to be $200. It can be a 20, $25,\\n$50 gift card to Amazon, $25 gift card at Amazon. Little tiny things that we can do go a long way for recognition. It doesn\\'t just have to be\\nan incentive recognition as like a bonus, something like that. So the little things, get creative, ask your Gen Zs, \"What\\nwould you like to see?\" And then maybe even\\ncreate a list or a domain, something where they can win points. And when they get to a\\ncertain amount of points, they get 200 points, they\\nget to go into this catalog and they get to buy something. And it helps with that recognition, wanting to be better at cybersecurity. Gen Z is three times more\\nattacked, more targeted, and they\\'re three times more\\nsusceptible to be breached. And this was an influencer\\nover here, Jana, and she was talking\\nabout living in Calvary. She was a a blogger, a travel blogger and she was really surprised\\nthat Gen Zs are so vulnerable. And what\\'s scary about\\nthat, in my opinion, is in by 2025 they\\'re gonna\\nbe a quarter of our population of the workforce and it\\'s\\nonly gonna go up from there. I think the age group\\nwe looked at was what? 17, 12, 12 years old? Yeah, it\\'s pretty young. That means from this point on, we\\'re either going to become more secure or less secure within our organization because we\\'re gonna get more and more Gen Zs that are coming in there. So if you\\'re not addressing\\nyour communication strategy now, now is the time to make it happen because in 2026 there\\'s\\njust gonna be more Gen Zs and there\\'s gonna be\\nmore younger generation, and what we\\'re utilizing\\nnow isn\\'t gonna work. So some use cases that I was able to identify when going through this that I think are extremely helpful for you all to either research, so I\\'ve created a link\\ndown at the bottom right that you can go into, or just have just\\ngeneral awareness around. So this right here is all about utilizing a mobile application for cybersecurity challenges. And what they did here is\\nthey had the users be able to go into the application,\\nthen navigate around it, so gamifying cybersecurity, and they were actually faced with real-world phishing\\nchallenges, real-world malware. They had to circumvent, go around it. And what was great about this is that there was over 100,000 downloads, which is pretty significant,\\n75% engage rate, and survey showed 50% increase in users\\' baseline understanding of cybersecurity, that\\'s impressive. Now, it didn\\'t give me the information, I don\\'t remember seeing information as far as the overall like age\\nparticular data in there. But this was focused primarily on Gen Z and the intent was to help\\neducate in cybersecurity. So this is something that you\\ncan do in your organization. The cost of the app and the\\nthings like this are in, like, they\\'re not that significant, in my personal opinion,\\nbased on your overall budget and the impact to the organization. Securing influencers. So this one right here is a case study where an organization\\npartnered with TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube to\\npublish cybersecurity things, like contact information, password security, MFA and patching. The individual was posting about the importance\\nof all of these things. And what they noticed\\nis that this influencer, in leveraging these\\nindividuals, they were able to reach over 500 million\\nviewers within three months. And it showed engagement metrics, this included the likes, the share, and the comments out of all\\nof that, which at the end led to another proactive\\ncybersecurity behavior. So I know this is more external-facing. What I would encourage you to do, if you were going to\\nleverage an influencer to be able to drive your\\ncybersecurity objectives, and I do know there\\'s actually\\na pretty significant cost when leveraging an influencer. It can be as little as\\nlike $500 all the way up to like $50,000 if you\\'re trying to use a Kardashian for example. So those are all things that\\nyou have to keep in mind. But including these into your budget, what I would do as a leader in this space, if I had individuals and we work, I would look at my industry and say, okay, we work in an education industry. So I would find an influencer\\nthat talks about education that is in the industry\\nthat I know that maybe a lot of my influencers are going\\nto follow, I would ask. Or not my influencers, my Gen Zs would follow that influencer. I would ask my Gen Zs,\\nthe younger gens of like, \"Who do you follow? \"Who\\'s a big name in the industry? \"Who do you like to see?\" Then I would reach out to the individual and work on creating a\\ncampaign at that point in time. This one might be a little hard though. I understand the budget. There are some constraints and\\nit does cost a lot of money. Another thing with an influencer though, a lot of marketing companies are getting on board recognizing the\\nimportance of influencers. So you can work through\\na marketing company and then they can push your message out to multiple influencers\\nat one period of time versus trying to target one\\nor maybe two influencers. This one right here is\\nall about escape rooms. Has anybody done an escape\\nroom in here before? I actually have never done an escape room. Kind of terrified me\\ngetting locked in the room. Yeah, no, but I\\'ll try that one day. But this is the concept of it, is they put you into a room and then you have to figure\\nout your way of getting out of this digital space\\nby like getting code. So escape room, if anybody doesn\\'t know, is you get into a room,\\nit\\'s usually themed based, like \"Pirates of the\\nCaribbean\" could be a theme, and based on the theme, you have all of these clues and the clues are around, I think there\\'s a book on that too, around the book or the movie. And then it can be pretty challenging. And then you try you,\\nthere are multiple clues, usually five to eight clues, maybe more, and then it gives you the\\nkey and you can get out. That\\'s a similar concept here. What they notice is out of thousands of participation in the first few months, pre and post surveys\\nactually showed 60% increase in the ability to identify and respond to basic cybersecurity\\nthreats, that\\'s huge. \\'Cause right now, that response piece, that\\'s being neglected. Like, they may be able to\\nidentify it, maybe they won\\'t, but they don\\'t know how to respond to it. And that response could be as simple as emailing your phishing team at the SOC, but understanding what\\nare those next steps? What are those next steps if\\nyou do click on a malware? Do you log yourself out of\\nall of your computer devices? And I know I, that was part of my, like, initial video as a joke,\\nbut people have done that. They assumed, \"Well, if I\\njust log out of everything, \"then they won\\'t have access\\n\\'cause I don\\'t have access.\" So like educating that it\\ndoesn\\'t actually work that way and it doesn\\'t work that way if you just get yourself offline. Like, understanding all of those concepts, this walks them through that. Now the last one we have here\\nis microlearning campaigns. Are you all familiar with micro education and how that works? Yeah, we\\'ve got a few\\npeople that understand that. I love micro education, that was part of why I actually started my\\nYouTube a few years ago. Ran outta time though. So I don\\'t have time to build all these micro education courses. But what I felt was really important is... And I started this because podcasts and how many people love podcasts? But then if they\\'re an hour long, it\\'s just hard to listen\\nto something for an hour. It\\'s the same with cybersecurity training. We don\\'t wanna sit there\\nfor 45 minutes to an hour. So how can we deliver\\ncybersecurity training in small bite-sized forms so they are able to ingest this data? And you do it through\\nmicrolearning, micro education. And they\\'ve noticed that these are... And what I\\'m doing at my organization, this will all be organization-dependent, I\\'m actually building out 15-second and 30-second clips,\\nmaybe even one minute, to start pushing out data\\naround cybersecurity initiatives that we have within the office of CISO. It could be as simple as... And not everybody\\'s funny here, I get it. And you\\'re like, \"I don\\'t\\nwanna be doing videos.\" But I promise you there is\\nsomebody in your organization that doesn\\'t mind getting\\nbehind a video camera. Engage the younger people\\nin your organization. Say, \"Hey, do you wanna\\ndo some videos for me?\" Have them do long-form content about talking about cybersecurity. Take the content and then\\nyou just break it down into 15, 30-second videos. That\\'s another way that you can do this, and then you push the information out. Another way that you can do this too is you can do long-form content. You can push that out, push out videos because the engagement,\\nmy personal opinion, the engagement of\\nnewsletters is going away. We\\'re not gonna be able to do newsletters because we are all inundated with newsletters coming\\ninto our inboxes, right? I personally, if I get a newsletter from a department, I just, I delete it. I really do wanna read it, but if I get a video that\\ncomes in in 30 seconds, 15 seconds, I know most of you are gonna at least take a few seconds and click on the video and watch a 15-second video, especially if it\\'s funny and\\nit\\'s something that comes in. So those are some ways. They notice that video, most of these videos can go like viral within the environment. Some reach millions including comments and questions within those videos. And they also noticed that the individuals that viewed these videos,\\nthey were more likely to change their digital behavior. So there is evidence that this works, even though it might seem a little silly and a little awkward to do\\nvideos like that, it does work and it is the direction that\\nwe need to start looking to be able to engage the Gen Zs. And millennials, \\'cause personally, I would rather do a 15-second video of cybersecurity to keep me abreast of information versus a half-hour video. So what I wanna do now\\nin these next two slides is provide you all with some strategies, some tips and tricks\\nthat you can take away as far as a communication\\nguidebook for your organization. So pro tip on this, I would\\nencourage you take these tips, take a picture of them, and then customize the Gen\\nZ communication guidebook and align it with your current overall organization guidebook. Everything you\\'re learning here, it\\'s not gonna change just by age. Like, it\\'s gonna work for\\nthe Gen Zs, the millennials, and even the Gen Xs. So first thing is all\\nabout active participation through gamified learning experience in cybersecurity training. So this could also include\\nlike the hands-on piece, but getting active participation\\nfrom the individuals. No more sitting behind the\\ncomputer and clicking away. I know that there\\'s a certain level of cybersecurity awareness\\nthat we need at that level because of cybersecurity\\ninsurance companies. They require that type of training. But how do we take a step outside of that to help make this a little\\nbit more fun for them? The next thing is\\nutilizing media platforms for cybersecurity education\\nand awareness campaigns. And this includes TikTok, there\\'s Twitter, you\\'ve got LinkedIn. I don\\'t think a lot of Gen\\nZs are actually on LinkedIn. Facebook, what is... Snapchat, I think there\\'s\\nprobably some others that I\\'m probably not even aware of. But staying current with those, I think I\\'ve got some Gen Zs\\nin here actually right now. So you can tell me if\\nthere\\'s other platforms. They\\'re looking at me\\nlike, \"Oh, man.\" (chuckles) Are there other platforms? What other platforms do you use? I did? All right, I got \\'em all covered. If I miss anything, don\\'t be afraid to speak up and let me know. And then the next, the third one is crafting engaging narratives to communicate cybersecurity\\nconcepts effective to Gen Z. We can\\'t just be doing the\\nregular cybersecurity training that we\\'ve done, copy and\\npaste, making it boring. We\\'ve gotta be more engaged\\nand we\\'ve gotta think outside of the box and be inventive and innovative and work with them. I would say bring in the\\nGen Zs, bring them in and be part of your cybersecurity\\nstrategy within the org. Next is creating a Gen Z\\ncommunication guidebook with key highlights and\\ncommunication strategies. So sitting down and actually\\nbringing your leaders together and creating a communication strategy with these individuals in mind\\ninstead of an afterthought, instead of just staying\\nwith the same status quo. This is when I would actually\\nhave a committee meeting, have a group of individuals come together, bring in Gen Zs and work\\nwith them and sit down and get their thoughts on this. Next is promoting a mentorship program to be able to connect the Gen Zs with other individuals in the organization and other leaders so\\nyou can stay connected. And this is not just\\nmentorship for career, but mentorship of knowing\\nwhat are their challenges? What are they going through? Get better connected. And then the last is being able to develop an interactive\\nonline resources. So this could be a Teams platform, this could be a SharePoint site. Something that there\\'s engagement for them to be able to go to to utilize. Why this is important is\\nbecause Gen Zs are all about the online communities. They have various different\\nonline communities that they partake in. When they come to work, they want to be part of a community. I talked about that in the\\nfirst couple of slides. They\\'re all about authenticity,\\nbeing part of community. I don\\'t feel like that was so much as a big thing for the older generations. We just kind of went to work\\nand we just did the thing. But think about it, they,\\na lot of these individuals, they joined the workforce\\nduring covid, they were at home. So their community was\\nstill very much online. Now they\\'re coming into the workforce. They want to still have those connections. They want to still have that engagement. Leverage that to be able to tailor your communication\\nstrategy to the Gen Zs. So what is your role in\\ncultivating this new vanguard, these new individuals coming in? And it\\'s understanding,\\nempowering, and collaborating. So understanding what are their needs, what are their behaviors? What are their preferences? How can you meet those preferences? And then how to empower them. At the end of the day, it\\'s\\nreally about em empowering all of us to be better secure\\nleaders in this space because we are the weakest\\nlink in the organization. Humans are the weakest\\nlink in the organization. So how do we empower one another to be able to support one another, to be able to create a\\nmore secure environment? And then being able to co-create. And I\\'m very much a leader all about collaboration and being transparent. And what I mean by this on\\nthe collaboration piece is that have a safe space. And it could be that\\nsocial media platform, it could be that Teams chat. Have a safe space where these individuals and the collective feels safe about bringing issues forward. See something, say something. But allowing them to come\\nforward with the things that they\\'re seeing and\\nnot being punished for it. But instead, in a way,\\nbeing rewarded for it, being appreciated for it. Because what that\\'s gonna\\ndo is you\\'re gonna start to cultivate a culture of empowerment and wanting to engage and\\nwanting to communicate out and wanting to secure our environments. And so the last thing, what I would like to see all of you do, if this\\nis something that you know that this is gonna be a challenge\\nwithin your organization, I can tell you it\\'s a\\nchallenge in our organization. And I\\'m already taking a role\\nin doing micro educations and helping create that strategy for us to communicate better with the entire organization, not Gen Zs. But what you\\'ve learned today, you can apply it throughout\\nyour entire organization. And so next week, what you\\nshould do, in my opinion, is that you should connect\\nwith your leadership, your managers, your executive team, and sit down with them and\\nprovide them some of this data that you received in this class. Provide them some actionable guidance to be able to help them define or redefine their cybersecurity\\ncommunication strategy. Look through the phishing data that you have right now within your org. How many people are passing\\nand failing that information? Can you get the age group of who is passing and failing that data? I don\\'t know if we can. I just saw my phishing data come back. We had like 1400 go out, I think. We had a pretty good success rate. I think 70% pass, 80% pass, which is actually pretty good\\nfrom the ones that I\\'ve seen. But my first question was can we get age demographics in there? Can we get the data of who is not passing? Because that\\'s gonna help you\\nwith your overall strategy. If the younger generation\\nis actually not clicking on the phishing email as\\nthe older, then you need to adjust your communication\\nstrategy accordingly. So that\\'s what I would do this\\nfirst week when you get back. I would try to pull that\\ninformation of your phishing data that you\\'ve done, the phishing\\ntest that you\\'ve done. I would meet with your leadership and I would see how are you doing with your communication\\nstrategies right now and how can you refine that, and then work on that refinement. And then in the first three\\nmonths following this, what I\\'d love for you guys to do and what I would love for you to see, find me on LinkedIn,\\nlet me know how it goes, is have a refined internal\\ncommunication strategy based on this discussion here. Take into consideration\\nthe younger generation, their engagement, how to gamify, how to make this fun and enjoyable. \\'Cause security, unless\\nyou\\'re in the security field, it really isn\\'t fun. I think it is, but most\\npeople do not think it\\'s fun. And then plan a social event. I really challenge you,\\nin the next three months, plan a social event, get engaged, engage your Gen Zs, have a fun time. Leverage social media. I\\'d put a Gen Z in charge\\nof your social media \\'cause they\\'re gonna know how to engage and how to put information out there. But create a social event\\nor even do a social media, maybe you can\\'t do a social event \\'cause you\\'re a hybrid team, my team is, but you can maybe do a\\nsocial media campaign. Get engaged is the point of\\nthat second bullet right there. Plan something that you start engaging your community much better. And then the last one, within six months, you should drive culture change. So culture change is really hard, I know. I\\'m trying to do culture change right now and changing a culture from the inside-out is extremely hard,\\nespecially when you\\'re trying to tap into a younger generation that maybe you\\'re not well connected with. So drive the culture change, create... And the way to do that, I believe, is creating a secure\\nand a safe environment to want to have change, to\\nwant to be able to speak up. So in six months, create\\na safe space for them. Create a Teams chat, create\\na mentor program so they, maybe it\\'s not a collective\\nthat they can talk to, but they have an individual\\nthey can talk to. Or maybe it\\'s a, you\\ncould create a committee or maybe it\\'s a program that you create. We have a Women in Tech program and men are able to come to it. But it\\'s a collective to talk about what is happening in the organization. Create something that allows that safe and secure space for them\\nto be able to communicate. And that is the end of my\\npresentation, I think so. Yeah, that\\'s a black screen, okay. (audience applauding) All right, 10 minutes. But if you guys have any questions, I am happy to answer any\\nquestions that you might have. Ron? All right. - [Ron] Thank you for thought provoking. I\\'m one of the older trying to work with the younger generation and I noticed I sometimes\\nspeak a different language. What can I do better\\nto encourage questions? \\'Cause I know a lot of Gen Zs,\\nthey tend to be a little shy, they sometimes feel more intimidated. So I wanna make sure they have that safe space to ask good questions. - [Jax] I think on that,\\nfrom my experience, we\\'ve got a couple of Gen Zs sitting here. I think the biggest thing is engaging and getting to know them\\nbefore you have a meeting, before you\\'re setting up\\nto have them ask questions, get to know them. If I saw you ladies walk\\nin, I would\\'ve walked over and introduced myself to make\\nyou feel more comfortable to know that I\\'m on your team. We\\'re collective, you\\nknow, we\\'re here together. I think that\\'s really important. Otherwise, if you\\'re in an environment and you want engagement, just\\nask them a question directly. Like, I asked you ladies\\na question directly and you gave me an\\nanswer and I engaged you and you engaged me back. Yeah, don\\'t be afraid to engage them. And ask for their opinion, they\\'re very, very bright, some of the brightest. I say engage \\'em, ask \\'em questions. Yeah, thanks Ron. - [Audience Member] Thanks, Jax, for that really awesome presentation. I am Gen X myself. I live with two teenagers who are Gen Z, and they seem to almost\\nwanna blow off completely the whole idea that it\\'s even an issue. But one of the things\\nthat I was struck by, as you were giving your really, really sound and actionable advice, one thing that I don\\'t think\\nwas actually spoken about but seems to be the next step\\nis also the user research, the user experience that is possible to grab from, like, the\\nnext step, you know? Like, if it didn\\'t work, if the phishing, if you did get hooked, so to speak, why?\\n- Yeah. - [Audience Member] And\\nthen if it\\'s a safe space, to use that as a way to, like, even make the next round more effective, or to speak to that, you know?\\n- Yeah. - [Audience Member]\\nInstead of being punitive, not that that was a message\\nat all that you sent, but it seems like a lot of\\ntimes, that is the response. It\\'s like wall of shame or punitive, when in fact, it could be like, \"Oh, this is interesting, we\\ncould use this as feedback. \"Where did you get tripped up?\" You know, \"What would\\'ve worked better?\" Really almost probably\\nfor every age group. And the, I don\\'t know if you had a comment about the user experience\\nor the user research, but the other thing I was gonna ask you, if you had specific experience with the ambassador kind of aspect, the peer ambassador aspect, but specifically targeted for Gen Zs. Kind of like influencers\\nbut more peer things. - And the peers, so let me follow up on your question really quick.\\n- Yeah. - [Jax] For the peer influencer question, are you talking within the organization? - [Audience Member] Yeah,\\nthere are organizations and they seem to be larger, generally, but have like cybersecurity ambassador- - [Jax] Yep. - [Audience Member] You\\nknow, I don\\'t even know if there\\'s a common name for those folks. But who are really eager\\nand interested and engaged and act as like brand\\nambassadors but for cyber- - I love that, yeah.\\n- To make it kinda cool. Yeah, to make it cool.\\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Audience Member]\\nAnd then they also have to have incentives.\\n- Yep. - [Audience Member] \\'Cause\\nit takes a certain amount of time to do that too. But I don\\'t know if you\\'ve had experience with that targeted\\nspecifically to the younger, super, super skeptical,\\nlike, \"No, I got that,\" even as they\\'re clicking on the UPS link, you know? (chuckles)\\n- Yeah, UPS link. They almost got me, the UPS link \\'cause I actually had a UPS package coming and I was like, \"Wait,\\nis this a real link?\" That\\'s why I always use that\\none \\'cause it was tricky. That\\'s a really good question. So I don\\'t have experience\\non the cybersecurity side with the ambassadors. I actually love that idea. We don\\'t have those at my organization. However, I have done things like that within the military and what we would do, 20 years served, still in the reserves, what I will do is I will find a private, I\\'m a warrant officer, I\\'ll get a private and that\\'s somebody that\\'s\\nvery young in the military. I will get them to help me get, they\\'re motivated and they\\nhelp drive that messaging. It makes it a lot easier because we\\'re talking\\nabout younger generation. You guys aren\\'t gonna,\\nyou lady, I keep, now I... They\\'re gonna leave now and they\\'re like, \"She keeps pointing at us.\" You\\'re lovely, I\\'m so glad\\nyou\\'re here, by the way. But it\\'s like you\\'re not gonna\\nwanna hear from me, right? You wanna hear from\\nsomebody of your own age. And it makes more sense to have somebody to be able to drive that message. \\'Cause in my opinion,\\ncorrect me if I\\'m wrong, I think it\\'s gonna have a bigger impact. Plus they\\'re gonna have way more energy and motivation than I am to go out there, create the social events,\\ndrive that messaging, and also help construct. \\'Cause I think another piece of that is you need to empower them to be able to go and construct that message\\nin the way that they want to. Not me telling them what the message is and then going out\\nthere \\'cause now you\\'re, like, impeding their creativity. But I think it\\'s a great program. I think it would totally work, yeah. Anybody else? - [Audience Member] So\\ntwo observations, I guess, in Gen Z in terms of other characteristics that can be very positive, but just something to kinda be aware of, is immediate gratification and fairness or the desire for,\\nlike, absolute fairness. What I mean by that is\\nimmediate gratification, think like TikTok, you know, you\\'re getting that wow, that fun factor. And fairness, you know,\\ntrying to make sure that regardless of gender,\\nrace, ethnicity, et cetera, that everything is completely\\nfair and that we\\'re being, as a human being, equal to everybody. Just wanna get your view, I guess, when you have new generations\\njoining an organization where there\\'s a period of time where maybe as you\\'re phasing out, you know, older staff or even staff that are not that much\\nolder but are more senior, and maybe aren\\'t necessarily\\npulling their weight, and as you have new staff coming in, they perceive this as very unfair, right? Meaning that coming into a\\nnew organization, you know, they\\'ll see that they\\'re\\nkilling themselves and maybe the person right next to them with the same job title is not, and don\\'t always understand\\nthat it may take time to exit somebody and kind of adjust that to create that equality. - [Jax] So the question is really around that diversity and inclusion piece, knowing that a younger\\ngeneration is coming in while an older is coming out and we\\'re gonna need change\\nto happen in the org. And how to address kind of those, the cultural changes while kind of trying to appease everybody. - [Audience Member] To to set\\nthe expectations, essentially. - [Jax] Yeah. - [Audience Member]\\nBecause again, you know, at some point, it can\\nbe perceived as unfair. - Yeah.\\n- I think, you know, some of the older\\ngenerations, myself included, I would, you know, or kinda,\\nI consider myself borderline, is you learn to kinda rise from the ranks, pay your dues, all those kinda things that build great work ethic. But when someone comes in which already has amazing enthusiasm and is killing themselves, they may not recognize\\nthat there\\'s a duration where you have to kind of, like, let people rise based on their merits. You can\\'t make certain types\\nof changes immediately. It just takes time, and that kind of goes against the immediate\\ngratification element. - [Jax] Yeah, yeah, and I see that. We have some young individuals in our org that got promoted really\\nquickly, for example. And there are individuals that come in, they expect to be at the director level as soon as they come in\\n\\'cause they have a master\\'s or a PhD in cybersecurity, and so they wanna get paid at\\nthe five to eight-year level. That\\'s a tough question\\nand it\\'s a tough challenge to address, but my opinion, it\\'s all about humanizing the problem. And what I mean by that is\\nit\\'s all about sitting down and understanding the\\nchallenge that you\\'re facing, understand the challenge\\nthe individual is facing. And then I think an\\nanswer to that could be you partnering up and\\nbeing a mentor to a Gen Z and being able to communicate\\nand for them to understand what it\\'s like and what they... Like, creating a career path for them and explaining why they\\'re here now and how they can get to this location. I think it\\'s all going to\\nbe about communication. I also think, and this may\\nbe a controversial answer, but I think there are gonna be\\nhurt feelings along the way. Change is hard. Typically, people don\\'t like change and you\\'re not gonna make\\neverybody happy as part of this. But I think you can attempt\\nto make everybody happy by listening and allowing\\nthem to be seen and heard. I think up to this point, we haven\\'t had the pressure\\nto be seen and heard or making sure our employees\\nare seen and heard, but now we have to. The younger generation is forcing us, in a lot of ways I think,\\nto do things better. And that\\'s part of that and\\nthat\\'s part of that inclusion. - [Audience Member] Perfect, thank you. - [Jax] Yeah, thanks. Awesome, I think that\\'s it. All right, thank you all.\\n(audience applauding) I really appreciate you\\nguys coming, thank you.', 'drive': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-_wLHwXLCc1cSjrt-xxFbDom0E8JmAnH'}, {'url': 'https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2024/10%20key%20challenges%20for%20ai%20within%20the%20eu%20data%20protection%20framework', 'title': '10 Key Challenges for AI within the EU Data Protection Framework', 'date': 'May 09, 2024', 'text': 'AI is addressed by the EU via the AI Act, the AI Liability Directive, the NIS2 Directive, the Cyber Resilience Act, the Digital Services Act, the E-Privacy Directive, and the GDPR.

You\\'re all right, you\\'re all very welcome. Thank you for doing the\\ngraveyard shift with me. I much appreciate it. You and Alicia Keys are\\nvery welcome in the room. So I can actually feel\\nAlicia not just here \\'cause the vibrations, but apparently this is not the worst room that those other rooms are worse. So as I\\'ve already said,\\nmy name is Valerie Lyons. I\\'m sure you can hear from my accent that I\\'m not a local, so I\\'m from Ireland. I hail from Dublin, I\\'m a recovering CISO. I was a CISO for many years,\\n15 years in KBC Bank in Dublin. And so after that I moved\\ninto privacy a decade ago. So I\\'ve spent the last 10 years working and studying privacy. My PhD is in privacy and trust. So ethics is kind of my place of comfort. I have something just to\\nnote that I did come over from Dublin with a large\\nnumber of suitcases on Sunday. And I packed what I\\nthought was everything, but I didn\\'t pack my glasses,\\nso I cannot read the screen. So I\\'m gonna be hugging this\\npodium like a lost child. And every now and then I\\nwill point to the screen, but I actually can\\'t read it. So just bear that in mind if you see the pointer in the wrong place. Before we begin, just a couple of things that we need to kind of clarify is what this session is about. So if you\\'re expecting me\\nto go through definitions of AI systems, we\\'re\\nnot gonna be going into that level of detail. We\\'d need a whole new session for that. What this is about is we have in Europe a piece of legislation called GDPR, and now we have a new piece of legislation that\\'s going to regulate how AI works within a European context. And it\\'s about the integration\\nof those two pieces of leg, those two, every\\nnow and then my mic goes. Those two pieces of legislation. It\\'s about how they\\nintegrate with each other, or as is the case most often\\nhow they don\\'t integrate. The way I\\'ve structured the slides is so that you have a lot\\nyou can take with you, that you can take home with you. So when it comes to the\\nsolutions to the challenges that I present, you\\'ll be able to take a lot of those solutions home with you. But I\\'m not gonna go through\\neach of those solutions. I put them in the slides so\\nthat you could have something that you could take away in\\nterms of audience takeaways. So that\\'s why they\\'re in the slides. And finally, just to\\nsay, this is my top 10, this is not the top 10. There are so many\\nchallenges in this space. When I curated these top\\n10, I almost felt like it was the Titanic and\\nI was trying to find the women and children\\nand put in the lifeboats because, you know, it was\\nreally difficult decision to make as to which ones I would include. So these are what I\\nbelieve are the top 10, but there are plenty more, take from me. Okay, so we shall begin. Apparently, this is sticky. So disclaimer will pass by,\\nyou know, the disclaimers. This is my disclaimer, okay? You say tomato, I say tomato. There\\'s a difference in\\nthe languages that we use. So I use words like personal data, data subject, and data protection. Whereas here in the US you use words like personally identifiable information, individuals and consumers, and privacy. And those words, we\\'ve\\ncome to kind of use them interchangeably, but they\\nactually mean different things in both of those different places. So I\\'m gonna move with the US context, and I\\'m gonna stick with that\\nparticular type of language. So let\\'s have a little\\nbit of a background. Anybody want to hazard a guess as to how long AI has been around? Throw me a number. 60 years. Well, it\\'s in the fifties. You know, that they say, so you very, a little bit more, in the fifties. Turing is the one who was\\nreally considered the father and the term became known in the sixties. But the big difference\\nis the time to reach a hundred million users,\\nso we see in 2006, Google Translate took 78 months to reach a hundred million users. And then we have ChatGPT, two months to reach a\\nhundred million users. And I know everybody\\nin this room is saying, \"I was one of those a\\nhundred million users.\" I certainly was, so the big difference is that time to reach a\\nhundred million users. And the other thing that has to be said, and it is about regulation. Regulation doesn\\'t exist in a vacuum. It exists, and the AI Act,\\nyou have to think about how it\\'s constructed,\\nand why it was created. It exists because\\norganizations traditionally didn\\'t do right by the data, they didn\\'t do right by the data subjects. So that\\'s why it exists. So when we\\'re talking about\\nthe regulation and the AI Act and GDPR just understand\\nthat it\\'s trying to address issues of the past and\\nanticipate issues in the future. So these are the top 10\\nthat we\\'ll be going through. It\\'s a whistle stop tour. Pretty much I\\'m gonna be\\ntalking for about 40 minutes. We\\'re gonna try and leave\\nsome time for questions. So it is a whistle stop tour,\\nmove with me on the tour. So there are some that are my favorites. I don\\'t know if anybody has favorites in terms of challenges. I don\\'t think any it\\'s\\nthe right word to use, but inferential data\\nnumber six there I think is the most interesting of the challenges. And the one that\\'s gonna\\ncause the most problems. I personally believe the\\nlegal basis for processing. Have we any lawyers in the room? Anyone want to admit a\\nlawyer, or an attorney? Sorry, I have to use your\\nlanguage, an attorney? No, we\\'ve none, okay,\\nwe can use English then. So otherwise we have to\\nspeak in attorney language. We\\'re gonna see this guy\\ncome up a couple of times as we go through the presentation. What this guy means is\\nthere are no answers. We actually don\\'t have a\\nsolution to the problem. And there\\'s plenty of this guy coming up. It is not that we don\\'t\\nknow what the answers are. We actually are waiting on the answers. We\\'re waiting on the end of inquiries. We\\'re waiting on cases, we\\'re\\nwaiting on interpretation, just as we did with GDPR. So we\\'ll have the answers\\nabsolute when we get those, but right now we\\'re kind of in a, we\\'re operating in a vacuum\\nwithout those answers. So the first challenge is the\\napproaches in terminology. The approaches are somewhat similar, but they\\'re also different,\\nand the differences are where we\\'re gonna\\nhave some complications. So GDPR, I\\'m assuming that everybody is kind of GDPR aware at this stage. GDPR relates to the processing of data. So it\\'s very much about personal data versus Special Category Data, but it\\'s always, the risk is\\nalways based on the individual. So GDPR is focused on the individual. The AI Act is focused on systems. The individual is not\\ninvolved at all in the AI Act. In fact, it carves it out and it says, \"Look to GDPR for data subject rights if we want to protect the individual.\" So the two have taken a\\ncompletely different approach. Penalties of up to 7\\nmillion or 7%, or 35 million for the most significant\\ninfringements of the AI Act. And penalties of up to 4% or 20 million for infringements of GDPR. Now the question that has\\nonly recently been answered in terms of the challenge\\nbetween these two is, if an AI system has a breach, and the breach involves personnel\\ndata, do we get hit twice? Do we have two sets of penalties? And the ICO, that\\'s the\\nInformation Commissioner\\'s Office in the UK has confirmed, yes, you do. So, you know, these are significant fines. Just on those fines, like,\\nto be fair, does everybody, you know, here in the US recognize that the Data Protection\\nCommissioner in Ireland has fined large tech companies\\nenormous amounts of money. So, you know, we hear that all the time. We\\'ve not got one penny. So I\\'m not too sure how much these fines are actually going to affect the progress of how we process data, but it\\'s there. So that\\'s the fines. We also have two interesting\\nthings, which is GDPR doesn\\'t allow you to process\\nSpecial Category Data unless you have a sort of a reason. A reason that\\'s included\\nin what\\'s called Article 9. And now we have a number of new uses of Special Category Data that\\nare allowed by the AI Act. So for instance, if you want\\nto use Special Category Data, one of eight categories,\\nif you want to use that for say, detecting and correcting bias or improving cybersecurity\\ncontrols, you can now use it. So that\\'s gonna require\\nan update into GDPR. And those Article 9 allowable uses are not the same in both those acts. So we\\'re gonna have to have a change made. This is how the AI Act approaches risk. So bearing in mind GDPR approaches risk in an entirely different way. It identifies four\\ndifferent kinds of systems. Unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, and minimal risk. So they\\'re the four\\ndifferent categorizations. The two we\\'re particularly interested in is high risk and limited risk. Obviously because they\\'re\\nthe ones we\\'re allowed to do and they\\'re the ones\\nhave obligations on us. So the obligations for\\ntransparency at limited risk level also rise up, transparency also\\napplies at high risk level, but we also have something else to do in the high risk level, which\\nis a conformity assessment. And many people are making\\nthe mistake of believing that a conformity assessment is the same as a data protection\\nimpact assessment in GDPR. It\\'s not, it\\'s not the same at all. It\\'s about compliance to the AI regulation and showing compliance\\nto the AI regulation. It\\'s not a data protection\\nimpact assessment, nor is it an AI impact assessment. And we\\'ll be talking about that later on. And I want to just point and\\ndon\\'t ask me to point at this because I won\\'t be able to find it. I want to direct your\\nattention to limited risk. You\\'ll see the last one in limited risk. There is deep fake, I\\ndon\\'t know who thought that that was a limited risk. You know, we\\'re hearing\\nabout disinformation and misinformation all\\nweek at this conference. I nearly called it concert because of what\\'s happening downstairs. So I don\\'t necessarily\\nagree with the risk levels that they have limited risk\\nthere, but it is in the act and that\\'s what their determination is. GDPR on the other hand takes a completely different approach. GDPR says the risk is the\\nrisk to the data subject, to the individual. And so it highlights\\nthat there are criteria that the European Data\\nProtection Board came out with a set of criteria and said, \"If any of these criteria apply, the risk is elevated to the data subject, and you need to do a data\\nprotection impact assessment.\" In other words, we\\'re looking at the risk to the data subject, to the individual, and not the risk to the\\nsystems that they\\'re using. And so this is gonna be\\na real complicated area. How do I know when to do\\na risk assessment with AI? One of the things in the\\ncenter, you\\'ll see there is use of new or innovative solutions. So I know if I\\'m using a\\nnew or innovative solution, which is AI, that I must do a data protection impact assessment. So we\\'re all in agreement. Well, in five years time, AI is not gonna be new or innovative. It\\'s just gonna be the normal, isn\\'t it? So how does it apply then? And I think we\\'re gonna\\nneed some more clarification on what that looks like. The Brussels Effect, this\\nis again, another approach. It\\'s the approach that\\nthe EU regulation love. They love to make the regulation\\nthat they are producing at the moment applicable globally. And so whilst we love it,\\neverybody else hates it. But essentially if you market\\nAI systems into Europe at all, you must comply with the AI Act. In GDPR, if you direct or\\ntarget data subjects in Europe, you need to comply with GDPR. But they\\'re still very\\ndifferent in terms of how do other organizations\\nwho may be, excuse me, target a market but not data subjects. Do they have to comply with both? And the answer is yes, they do. Second challenge is\\naccountability and governance. Accountability is in\\nboth the AI Act and GDPR and it means exactly the same. So it\\'s not a challenge\\nby virtue of the fact that they are the same. We have accountability requirements. And all accountability means is that if a data protection commissioner or supervisory authority\\nis sitting across from you and asks you, \"Explain how you\\ncame up with that decision.\" You need to have a set of\\ndocumentation available to you to be able to say, \"This is what we did. This is how we came up with that.\" That\\'s really what accountability means. The Data Protection\\nCommissioner in Ireland has produced this as the\\ndefinition for accountability, which pretty much backs\\nup what I just said. The problem with accountability\\nis that the overall problem is relying on organizations\\nto assess the risks they create is like asking\\nthe fox to assess the dangers to those in the hen house. And that essentially is the\\nproblem with accountability and particularly with AI, is\\nwe\\'re asking organizations to assess the risks that they create. How to address this challenge. Well, we have a number\\nof different things, but one of the most important is that the European Data\\nProtection Supervisor has noted that for accountability, the best thing we can do\\nis to look to standards. And they particularly\\ncall out ISO and NIST. And I think the reason\\nthey called out those two is because both have got\\ncybersecurity, privacy, and an AI governance and\\nrisk management components. So I think that\\'s why\\nthey called out those two. The next one I\\'d like to highlight there is including human\\nrights, ethics, fairness in GDPR\\'s impact assessments. If anybody\\'s ever tried to do that, a data protection impact assessment, and looked for the ethical\\nelement, they would struggle to find the ethical\\nelement in any templates. So for anybody who is in that space, who\\'s trying to do that at the moment, there\\'s a great paper from a scholar, called Alessandro Mantelero,\\nhe does a lot of work for IAPP. He wrote it in 2018 and it\\'s\\ncalled \"A Blueprint for AI.\" And in it, what he does\\nis he takes human rights, ethical impact assessments, and he combines them with data\\nprotection impact assessments to form a data protection\\nethical impact assessment. So it\\'s the best template that I can find. And so it\\'s a great paper to read as well. Okay, the third challenge,\\ndata subject rights. We love them in Europe, and I understand that in\\nthe US they hate them. So we believe that they\\'re\\npowerful consumer rights that we essentially have. And they really are powerful,\\nbut unfortunately they create a lot of problems for the AI regulation. To try and explain, because in the context of maybe not understanding\\nwhat it feels like to have these rights, so if\\nyou\\'re from a jurisdiction that doesn\\'t have these rights, to try to get a sense\\nof what it looks like, I think the best way for me to do that is just to give you this example. This is my little box of secrets. I\\'d like you to put into my\\nlittle box of secrets here, to imagine this to be\\nan AI tool that you use, that you have used, and\\nthen we can talk about that. Now, I\\'d say if I did a\\nhands around the room, 75% of you are probably\\nthinking about the same AI tool, but we\\'ll move with it anyway. So let\\'s think about it,\\nwhat goes into the box? Yeah? So what is the source of it? And this is a big problem because I was at one of the\\nconference sessions I was at, they spoke about when data\\'s\\nmanifestly made public, how we can use that data,\\nusing AI data scraping. That is the case in the US but\\nit\\'s not the case in the EU. Just because something\\'s\\nmanifestly made public doesn\\'t mean you can use it\\nfor any purpose you wish. You need to have a legal basis in Article 6 to process data. So the source of the data\\nhas to be a legal source. And we\\'re gonna talk about this. This is one of the reasons\\nGarante shut down open AI. Am I informed? Am I told that my data has\\nbeen used to train a model? Can I object or challenge the data? Can I say that I don\\'t want that data? Can I take my consent away from that? Is it legal or compliant? Does it have a legal\\nbasis in GDPR\\'s Article 6? Which we\\'ll be talking\\nabout that legal basis. Inside the box, something happens, okay? There\\'s processing that\\noccurs inside the box. Again, I have the right under the AI Act to know what exactly is that processing. Can I object to it? Can I challenge it? Is it legal or compliant? Does it have a legal element\\nin in Article 6 of GDPR? And most importantly, is\\nit profiling or predicting? Because if it is, then we need\\nto think about something else as well, which we\\'re\\ngonna go into later on. And what comes out of the box? Now, let\\'s just think about generative AI. What comes out of the box? Did we create, did we\\nask ChatGPT way back when to tell us about our biographies? You know, many of us were\\ndead in our biographies. There was a lot of problems with accuracy. So what data comes out of the box? Back to those data subject rights, Am I informed that that\\ndata has been predicted or that I have been profiled? Can I request it to be deleted? It\\'s almost impossible to delete data from once it\\'s gone into the training set. Can I get access to the data? Can I make a subject access request without compromising\\nother people\\'s privacy? Unlikely, and does it have a legal basis? So there\\'s our data subject\\nrights, and that\\'s ChatGPT. And the answer is really no\\nto a lot of these things. So what can we do in the meantime? In the meantime, we can\\npublish privacy notices that are what are called\\naware so that they\\'re activity and processing aware. Now we give more information than we traditionally did in the past. We need to establish a legal basis. We\\'re gonna talk about\\nthat, the legal basis, a really complicated one for AI. Most likely we\\'re gonna have to go for what\\'s called legitimate interest, and it needs to be compliant. Again, inside the box, the\\nrecommendations seem to be that we need to do a DPIA, with including an ethical\\nimpact assessment, and obviously for high risk\\nsystem, a conformity assessment. And then for what data\\ncomes out of the box, we\\'re being recommended to use things like differential privacy to update our subject access request processes. These sound very, very straightforward, but these are not easy\\nthings to implement. So you can see the complications\\nthere that we have. Data minimization and\\npurpose limitation principles in GDPR, and they\\'re very integrated. I need to limit the purpose of data because I can only use data\\nfor the purpose, Article 6. And that results in having\\nminimum data collected in order to meet that purpose. So if we look, it\\'s gotten sticky, the AI Act explicitly\\nprovides that GDPR principles apply to training, validation,\\nand testing data sets. So Garante, as we might well remember, didn\\'t in fact have a legal basis to process the data in Europe. It did in the US when it\\ndeveloped its training set. Scholars, almost every paper that you read coming out in 2023 and 2024\\nsays it\\'s nearly impossible to perform any meaningful\\nlimitation, or data minimization for data used to train general AI systems. And the ICO, the Information\\nCommissioner Office in the UK has said that developers who\\nrely on very broad purposes are likely to have difficulties. Now, I don\\'t really know\\nwhat difficulties means, but one would suspect\\nfines is what it means. The ICO have conducted a number of, what are are called, call for evidence. So that, so they encourage\\nexperts to submit in their call for evidence. And then they pull it together\\nand they produce a report. So the first one, the generative AI call for evidence for purpose limitation. In it they outline, so if\\nyou\\'re interested in that space, in that report they outline a solution which is looking for exceptions. So there\\'s a number of exceptions in GDPR and you can look to that paper to see what exceptions you can leverage\\nto avoid the limitations set by the purpose limitation. One of the things that, this\\nis just a list of things you could do to address this challenge, is if using AI to make\\nsolely automated decisions about people with legal\\nor significant effects, you can also consider,\\nand you have to consider for high risk systems, that\\na human must be involved. They call it a human in the loop. Again, we don\\'t know exactly\\nhow this is gonna work, but it mandates that a human\\nin the loop be involved. So the legal basis. Has everybody come across\\na legal basis under GDPR? Do they understand what legal basis? Okay, that\\'s great. Article 6, the legal basis under GDPR. This is the series of legal\\nbasis really that we can use. There\\'s other legal basis\\nlike vital interest. We\\'re never gonna be able to use them. So this is the list that we can use, or that have possibilities. Consent is not a possibility because really I\\'m not gonna be able to take my consent away. So I have to be able to\\nremove my consent easily. I won\\'t be able to do that. Consent has to be fully informed. That\\'s also gonna be a\\nproblem when we\\'re developing training sets about fully informing. So it\\'s a complicated area,\\nand consent is to be avoided. Contractual obligation,\\nwell, we think we can use contractual obligation if\\nthere was a contract in place before we introduce the AI. So we think that that\\'s a possibility. Legal obligation, well,\\nthere\\'s no legal obligation yet to use an AI system, so we can\\'t use that until we have such a legal obligation. And then there\\'s legitimate interest. Now, legitimate interest\\nis one that organizations tend to rely on after they\\'ve\\nexhausted all the other ones. The problem with legitimate interest is that you have to be\\nvery clear when you do what\\'s called a legitimate\\ninterest assessment on the proportionality and\\nnecessity principles, okay? Two really important principles, and I think we\\'re gonna struggle to get the necessity\\nprinciple in that space. Again, we don\\'t know the answer to that. We have to wait and see. If we look to Garante. Garante is the Italian\\nData Protection Authority. So they issued a desist processing order to open AI for ChatGPT,\\nwe may well remember that. The reasons that they did\\nit, they were fourfold. There was an inadequate privacy policy. That\\'s okay, like, if we think about that, practically every\\norganization has an inadequate privacy policy, their boilerplate, they\\'re copied from others. They also didn\\'t have\\nappropriate age controls. Again, you wouldn\\'t think\\nthat that would be big enough to issue a desist processing order, considering all that Meta has done and they were never issued\\na desist processing order, but they didn\\'t have a legal\\nbasis for the training data. And that\\'s not fixable,\\nthe data\\'s in there. The horse is bolted,\\nthe model has learned. Even if they did remove the data now, the model has still learn from it. So I don\\'t think that\\'s fixable. And I think the approach has\\nbeen that there, you know, it\\'s better to seek forgiveness\\nthan to ask permission. I think that might\\'ve been the\\nOpenAI decision at the time. And accuracy, accuracy\\nand and hallucinations were a huge problem at the time. So OpenAI had to address a\\nnumber of different issues, but it still unable to\\naddress a legal basis issue. Where\\'s that gonna end? Nobody knows, but I think what\\'s\\ngonna happen in this space is that we\\'re going to have to say a legal basis is required. And for everything that\\'s done already, we\\'re just gonna have to sort of have an acceptance that it\\'s done. The horse has bolted on the ones that have already been trained. Inferential, derived data. Now this is my favorite,\\nas I said earlier. I do think that there\\'s a monster here, this is Pandora\\'s box. So there\\'s a number of\\ndifferent words we use to describe inferential data. We call it derived data, inferential data, predictive data, profiling data. There\\'s lots of different\\nwords we use to describe this kind of data, but it\\'s\\nnot data that the data subject or the individual gave the organization. It\\'s data that got created, so\\nhow do they know you have it? So we\\'re just gonna talk a little bit about the complications of that data, and how there are so many inconsistencies before AI ever existed. So, or ever existed as in\\nthe AI Act ever existed. In 2022, the CJEU, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a ruling in a Lithuanian case, which had nothing to do\\nwith data protection. It was an anti-corruption case. But they were asked to\\nassess whether personal data that can indirectly\\nreveal sexual orientation falls under protections for\\nSpecial Category Data in GDPR. Now, essentially what\\nthe case was about was, if my name is Mary and\\nI\\'m married to Louise, and you\\'re in a governmental office, the expectation is that you\\ncan infer my sexual orientation as it\\'s the same sex marriage and therefore you have to treat the data as Special Category Data. There\\'s additional obligations on you under Special Category Data\\nand an additional obligation for a legal basis for\\nprocessing from Article 9. So the CJU interpreted that\\nthe processing in personal data liable to disclose sexual\\norientation in this way constituted processing\\nof Special Category Data. So that\\'s what the CJEU said. In the same year, Norway\\'s DPA, their Data Protection\\nAuthority said that breaches, Grindr breach the GDPR\\nbecause somebody using Grindr inferentially indicates\\ntheir sexual orientation, and all data in Grindr\\nshould therefore be treated as Special Category Data. So they concurred really\\nwith what the CJEU had said, but then the Spanish Data\\nProtection Authority came along in relation to the Grindr case and said, no, they disagreed with that. So we had inconsistency in this space. And I can understand the\\ninconsistencies as well because it is so complicated to decide whether it actually is\\nSpecial Category Data or not. This is only gonna grow with AI, because AI has the\\ncapacity to pattern match in a way that we never could. So it\\'s the pattern matching allows for the inferential data to grow. Let\\'s take a look, because what I think about inferential data\\nis, there\\'s so many, many incredible inferences\\nthat can be made, but there\\'s also so many\\ntroubling inferences. And we don\\'t want to stop\\nthe inferences being made that are so positive in our society. We want to be able to\\nlimit the troubling ones. So here\\'s a list of some interesting ones. So Facebook and Meta, Facebook Meta, whatever you want to call it. Sexual orientation is\\nwhat they\\'re able to infer your sexual orientation,\\nrace, and political opinion. So these are very uncomfortable places. You don\\'t want to be these\\nthings to be inferred, but they can also infer\\nimminent suicide attempts. So it\\'s a very important\\nthing to be able to do, a powerful thing. Susceptibility to depression. Also, Instagram, X are able to infer susceptibility to depression. The most interesting one,\\nI think is Microsoft, which undertook a study\\nof mouse movements. So it looked at the mouse movements and tremors using the mouse\\nmovement and scrolling velocity. And it was able to detect\\nearly onset Parkinson\\'s to such a degree that it matched the scientific early onset tests. And, you know, so that\\'s\\nincredible scoring systems. We\\'ve been using scoring\\nsystems for years. So like Uber and eBay. And a really interesting\\none is judging citizens or organizations\\' behavior\\nand trustworthiness. Now, AI Act says you\\'re\\nnot allowed to do that because that\\'s considered\\na prohibited activity. So you\\'re not allowed to\\ndevelop a system that does that. But of course in China they have the social credit scoring system. And in Europe we would say,\\nand I know the US would do too, that there\\'s a level of\\ndiscomfort with that. So we would consider that\\na troubling inference. But I teach a master\\'s program\\nin information security, privacy and ethics in\\nDublin City University. And in that university we have\\na lot of Chinese students, and they consider this\\na beneficial inference, not a troubling. And that\\'s why privacy sometimes\\nis a wonderful subject, because there isn\\'t a\\nblack and white in it. What might be troubling inference to some may not be a troubling\\ninference to others. So it isn\\'t black and white. And I think in this space, we\\'re gonna see a huge set of challenges as we grow in our capacity to use AI. So back to the lovely data subject rights. The main vehicle that\\nprivacy laws provide, the main vehicle that privacy laws provide for addressing predictions\\nis to provide individuals with the right of access, and of course, the right to correction. But it doesn\\'t work for predictions because they pertain to events\\nthat have not yet occurred, accurate or inaccurate. And again, we don\\'t know\\nhow this is gonna look. We don\\'t know how this is gonna, how we\\'re gonna manage\\nthis issue going forward. We again, we have to wait on cases. I think that\\'s really where\\nwe\\'re going to get progress in this, is through cases. Transparency, a very difficult thing. Transparency is not a new issue. We\\'ve had privacy policies for years that have been so untransparent,\\nthey\\'ve been opaque. But transparency is definitely an issue when it comes to training data, and transparency is definitely an issue when it comes to algorithms. So anybody ever use Ticketmaster? Ticketmaster, nobody knows\\nhow tickets are assigned using Ticketmaster, and pre AI Act. I try to find out using\\nGDPR, but they could only, the only thing they could\\ntell me is about my data. And that\\'s all that\\'s allowed under GDPR. I can only make a complaint about my data. Under the AI Act, anyone\\nis allowed to complain about an AI system. It may not be related to their\\ndata, but they can complain because there\\'s a complaints\\nauthority, about an AI system. So, you know, when they\\nbuild that infrastructure, I\\'m gonna be in the front of the queue with the Ticketmaster to say, \"I want an explanation\\nfor how they process data. I want to know how seats get assigned.\" So it\\'s gonna be an interesting space. The transparency piece\\nbecause of the AI Act applies not only to the data,\\nbut also to the algorithms, and to the processing of the data. So it\\'s a watch this\\nspace because the argument that most organizations are gonna do is trade secrets, isn\\'t it? That\\'s where they\\'re\\ngonna go is trade secret. So this is a quote from\\nPro, pro, excuse me, professor Daniel Solove. If anybody knows him, I\\nalways say to my class, my students, you know,\\nif I show them a video of Professor Solove that nobody\\nspeaks when Daniel speaks. So I\\'m a bit of a girl fan. So to fully comprehend the\\ndecision making processes of these algorithms, it\\'s\\nnecessary to consider the collective data of all the individuals included in the algorithm\\'s data set. But we can\\'t provide\\nthat data to individuals without violating the\\nprivacy of all the people in the data set. So, you know, our leading scholars think this is not an easy challenge to resolve. So we\\'re not gonna be able to resolve this challenge overnight ourselves. How to address the challenge. Again, it\\'s explanation aware, the ICO says explanation\\naware is about all we\\'ve got in terms of the tools in\\nour arsenal at the moment, is to improve those privacy policies, improve those privacy notice, and make them explanation aware. Accuracy is my second most favorite one, because it also includes truth. And truth, and we have\\nseen this never before as we have in the last six months. Truth is so important. What is true and what isn\\'t true? Truth is the fundamental\\nthat democracy is built on to understand that our\\nvote, for instance, is true. That our journalist is true. These are the pillars that\\ndemocracy is built on. So it\\'s very important\\nto get this piece right, but we\\'re not getting\\nit right at the moment. So everybody know this test? I don\\'t know, has anyone\\ncome across it before? It\\'s called the chihuahua muffin test. And for many years AI\\ncouldn\\'t get it right, okay? It wasn\\'t able to detect,\\nwhich was a teddy and which, or which was a chihuahua\\nand which was a muffin. But the human can, okay? We are a bit confused by it, but we can definitely make the selection. Now AI can do that now,\\nin 2020 it couldn\\'t. So AI can do that now. I\\'m just gonna go forward\\njust one, into this one. But what the human is not able to do and what the AI is able to do\\nis to spot a deep fake, okay? So the AI can\\'t spot the difference between the chihuahua and\\nthe muffin, but we can. And we can\\'t determine what\\nis deep fake and what isn\\'t. But they can, and this\\nis an interesting space. There is no answer to it, but I\\'d just like to\\npoint out that I think this is gonna be Pandora\\'s box also. So does the World Economic\\nForum Global Risk Report, which says it\\'s number two,\\nAI generated misinformation and disinformation as\\none of the five risks that we believe are gonna be\\na material crisis globally. And so, it\\'s watch this space. We know that we\\'ve seen,\\nand this particular example has been used a number of times\\nin sessions during the week, which was the chief financial officer, the deep fake CFO insisting\\nthat the financial clerk wire 25 million, and they did\\nwhat they were asked to do, of course, because they\\nbelieved it was a real person. So what can we do in this space? So how to address the challenge. Well, there\\'s a number\\nof things, for instance, that the ICO would say that we need to do. One of them is we need to start\\ndoing DPIAs on everything. Not just on what the GDPR\\nsays a DPIA should be done on. We also need to consider validity codes. In other words that if I\\'m on a Zoom call and I\\'m the CFO, I need\\nto have a validity code, which is a code that I communicate during the course of the conversation that allows you to know I\\'m not fake. So I think it\\'s a new\\nconcept, these validity codes. It\\'s like, when we needed to be able to authenticate ourselves\\nmany, many years ago, we started using passwords,\\nthey became ineffective, we had multifactor authentication. I think this is just an extension to that authentication mechanism. Then we have bias, so bias\\nisn\\'t specifically in GDPR. What\\'s in GDPR is the\\nprinciple of fairness rather than bias. Does anyone remember Tay, Tay? So Tay 2017, Microsoft\\nlaunched Tay in China. Tay spent a number of weeks in China learning from tweets in order\\nto be a chat bot really, and would become your friend. And Tay was sweet, Tay\\nwas kind, Tay was loving, Tay was just a really nice chat bot. And then they decided that\\nthey were gonna launch it into the US, and they\\nlaunched it in the US. And they had to pull it within 24 hours, because in the words of the reporter, it had gone to racist in 24\\nhours, in less than a day. And so many people then started talking about the bias in the data in the US data. And this is where I think the problem is, is that actually the\\ndata was biased in China. They just didn\\'t see that\\nit was biased in China. When the data is loud,\\nthen you see the bias. But when the data is quiet, you don\\'t see the bias so easily. Chinese people operate under panopticon. The effect of the\\npanopticon, or should I say, they operate under the\\ngreat firewall of China. They know it exists, they\\nknow they\\'re being watched, they behave in a way that\\nessentially is biased data. It\\'s not real, it was quietly biased data. It moved over here, it\\nbecame loudly biased data. They saw that the data was biased, and they said, \"You know what? We need to fix this problem.\" But they should have known\\nthat it was biased over here and they didn\\'t because it was quiet bias. And I think that this is a\\nreal problem, is quiet bias. The one that doesn\\'t make\\nnoise, the one that isn\\'t seen. If we think about diversity, and we think about men and women, I went\\nto a conference recently where the keynote speaker was talking about trying to get an image generator, an AI image generator to generate an image of a CEO that was female. And she went through a\\nnumber of different tasks to try to get this to happen. Even going as far as saying\\nI wanted to be the CEO of a tampon company, and\\nit still was a male CEO. She could not get a male or a female CEO to be generated by the AI. And that\\'s quiet, that\\'s quiet bias. And that\\'s the one I think that\\nis the most dangerous bias. So what we did with the bias was we introduced anti-bias tools. And so we introduced\\nthese tools to unswing in a different direction,\\nbut we swung too much. So we ended up with images. This is Gemini, images from Gemini saying, \"Here\\'s a portrait of a\\nfounding father of America. Here\\'s an image of a Viking. Here\\'s the image of a Pope.\" The one that I find most amusing in that is the image of a Viking,\\nbeing from Ireland, I know that the Vikings came\\nand they brought red hair, fair skin, and blue eyes,\\nso it\\'s just interesting that that\\'s the image of the Viking. So I think we\\'re gonna,\\nyou know, unswing again, but that we need to get\\nthese anti-biased tools more effective. So what can we do in this space? Well, how to address the challenge. Number six there is the most interesting, is ethical frameworks. Finding an ethical framework\\nis quite difficult right now. And there\\'s one from the Omidyar Network. It\\'s called The Ethical\\nOS, eight key points. You basically take your development team and you say, \"Let\\'s talk\\nabout is there a possibility for bad actors to use this in a way that we don\\'t want it to be used?\" It\\'s trying to anticipate\\nrisks that aren\\'t so evident. It\\'s trying to anticipate that quiet bias. So it goes through eight\\nparticular different areas, disinformation,\\nmisinformation, inequality, and try to explore those\\nthrough an ethical framework at development state, so\\nbuilding it in early on. And then finally,\\nresponsibility for assessment. So what is that\\nresponsibility for assessment? We have a conformity assessment. It only has to be conducted\\non a high risk system, but we also have a data\\nprotection impact assessment. So who\\'s gonna do it? So the difficulty is, this,\\nif we talk about the approach. This is the four bodies that\\nare identified in the AI Act. So we have providers, importers, distributors, and deployers. They\\'re the four bodies\\nthat are in the AI Act. In GDPR, we don\\'t have these guys at all. In GDPR, we have data\\ncontrollers and data processors. And there\\'s zero alignment between them. So we can have a deployer\\nthat\\'s a data controller, and we can have a deployer\\nthat\\'s also a processor. We can have a provider\\nthat\\'s a data controller, and a provider that\\'s a data processor. Although they\\'re likely\\nto be data processors. And we have a joint\\nrelationship between deployers and providers because somebody can create their own AI system and then they become a provider and a deployer. The lack of alignment between\\nthe two pieces of legislation means that, you know, the responsibilities of data controllers and the\\nresponsibilities of providers or deployers, and they\\ncall them deployers. They used to call them users. I don\\'t know why they changed\\nthe term to deployers, but I\\'m guessing there\\'s a reason. So I think that this is gonna be a really, really complicated space as to who\\'s supposed to do\\nthe conformity assessment. But it\\'s gonna be the provider that has to do the conformity assessment. But there\\'s gonna be organizations that are joint deployers and providers. So who\\'s gonna do the conformity\\nassessment in that case? Again, it\\'s what this\\nspace, we need to have cases to be able to make interpretation. For anybody who does want\\nto do the assessment, the conformity assessment,\\nthere is a free tool available from the University of Oxford. Luciano Floridi wrote a paper about it. You can just go to that free tool and you can do the assessment. But it\\'s a really easy way\\nto kind of walk yourself through your first conformity assessment. If you have to do one. So that\\'s it for me. I\\'d like to move to questions now. If anybody would like to ask a question. We have mics. - [Attendee 1] First\\noff, I\\'m really impressed that you were able to keep\\ngoing with all the noise. You\\'re my new hero \\'cause I would\\'ve just, I would\\'ve thrown a temper\\ntantrum and walked out. So, good job there.\\n- Thank you. - [Attendee 1] The thing I\\nreally want to try to get at is how are these rules going to work when things are changing so quickly in terms of the AI landscape? And if companies see these\\nrules coming, you know, it\\'s difficult now for companies\\nkind of virtualized risk because somebody\\'s doing it. But once you have kind of\\nan AI responsible for it, how is the EU going to\\nkeep that responsibility from just like, becoming just whisper air? - [Dr. Lyons] It\\'s a great question. I mean, I think it\\'s\\ntantamount to impossible. The AI Act was the fastest\\npiece of legislation ever produced by the EU. The amount of money that was\\nput in and invested in it. But I don\\'t think you can keep\\nup that speed of response. I just don\\'t think it\\'s possible. And I think if you go back to,\\nif you remember what I said, it doesn\\'t get created in a vacuum, and that it\\'s bad organizations. And I think what we have to rely on, and we had to do it with GDPR as well. We had to rely on organizations adhering to the spirit of the law, not just the letter of the law. You know, and I think most\\norganizations will do that. I think a lot of organizations\\nare really, really good. But if we go back to what Eric\\nSchultz said up 15 years ago, \"Google likes to get right\\nup to the creepy line, but it never crosses it.\" You know? Other organizations are happy\\nto go across that creepy line. And so, I don\\'t know\\nthat we\\'re gonna be able to keep up pace with that, but I think it\\'s a great question. - [Attendee 2] Thank you very\\nmuch for the presentation. A couple of questions. One is specifically on GDPR, and I think GDPR and CCPA,\\nthe California Act, you know, they both give the customer the right to actually tell the\\ncompany to forget them, and not use their data\\nfor, it\\'s not just the PII, but not use it for like, analytics or anything of that nature. You did mention, and I\\nthink it came up yesterday in the crypto panel as\\nwell, that once the model has been trained right? Then it\\'s very difficult to\\nactually delete the data. So what are companies doing then? I mean, are they deliberately\\nbreaking the law then, and saying, \"Yeah, you\\nknow, we won\\'t be able to delete your data.\" Like? - [Dr. Lyons] Yeah, absolutely. That\\'s why organizations like\\nOpenAI have been used as, and the example, if you don\\'t fix this, we\\'re gonna shut you down. Just on the previous point,\\nCCPA is similar to GDPR, but it doesn\\'t have the same\\nlevel of data subject rights. There\\'s two specific rights in CCPA. So it has a limited number\\nof data subject rights, but there\\'s more rights\\nin GDPR than there is in. That\\'s the first part. Yeah, organizations are operating\\nat the moment illegally, and that\\'s why they can be shut down. But I think they\\'re also,\\nthere\\'s an acceptance that this was a problem\\nthat couldn\\'t be fixed, so we didn\\'t fix it. And so now we have a situation\\nwhich is organizations bought into something inappropriately, but they didn\\'t do it intentionally. - [Attendee 2] Okay, the\\nsecond question I had was, there was talk about legal\\nobligation to use AI. What if the company cannot actually run the operation effectively\\nwithout using AI? Is that enough for a reason? Like you saw a lot of\\npresentations yesterday by cybersecurity companies\\nsaying, \"Hey, you know, we could not solve this problem before.\" - Yeah.\\n- We can do it now. So if you don\\'t use AI and you\\'re back to like\\npeople chasing the problem, then there aren\\'t enough\\nresources, there isn\\'t enough time. So we basically won\\'t be\\nable to protect the company, or won\\'t be able to protect the customer. - [Dr. Lyons] So that legal basis is called legitimate\\ninterest, believe it or not. Legal obligation means\\nthat, say for instance, if I wanted to launder\\nor not launder money. If I\\'m being told by the government that I must check your passport, then I have a legal obligation\\nto process your passport, because the government has\\ntold me that I must do that in order for you to set up a bank account. Know your customer legislation. So that\\'s a legal obligation. That an organization\\ncan\\'t operate its business without AI is a legitimate interest. That\\'s the legal basis that you would use. But to do legitimate interest, you have to be able to stand\\nover the proportionality in the sets of the principles. - Okay.\\n- Does that answer? - [Attendee 2] So, yeah, it does. I do have another question,\\nbut I\\'ll give some time to you. - [Dr. Lyons] I don\\'t know\\nif he was, but go for it. - [Attendee 3] Hi, thank you for the talk. My question is, my company\\'s\\ntraining models using data from both the US and the EU that is totally de-identified of any PII. And my question is, we wouldn\\'t\\neven have a way to find, if someone requested the data be removed, we wouldn\\'t even have a way\\nto find whose data that is. So would that be okay? Is there something else we can do? - [Dr. Lyons] So is that the\\nanswer is that, you know, if you\\'ve used the data, and a lot of the differential\\nprivacy would be another place where you\\'d see the data\\nkeeping the value of it, but de-identifying it. If you\\'ve used the data, you have access to the data originally,\\nbut now you\\'ve stripped it. And if I want you to remove that data, the only place I can ask\\nyou to remove that data is in the value of what you\\'ve trained. But you can\\'t undo that. It\\'s not possible for you to undo that. So the answer is I can\\'t do it, but the legislation\\nsays in GDPR, you must. And so we\\'re at a space where\\nwe\\'re gonna have a case, and when we get a case, the CJEU are gonna have to make a\\ndecision on how that progresses. But you\\'re absolutely\\nright, you cannot deliver on that request at the moment. And there\\'s no fix for that. But I think you can\\'t turn\\naround to say to organizations that you\\'re gonna have\\nto stop doing business. We can\\'t do that. - [Attendee 3] Thank you. - [Dr. Lyons] I\\'m being\\nreminded to let everybody know, to make sure to put in\\nthis survey results. - [Attendee 4] Good\\nafternoon, thank you so much for this lecture, it\\nwas super informative. I used to work for a member of Congress and I\\'m actually writing\\na research paper now about assessing risk,\\nparticularly about the AI Act. The four different tiers. There isn\\'t really a\\ntest that I\\'m aware of to determine whether or not a software, or like an AI program is very harmful. So therefore, why would anyone\\ncategorize their program as very harmful when\\nit\\'s quite restrictive? And please if you know of any\\nleads, I\\'m very interested. - [Dr. Lyons] And no,\\nand so it\\'s harm in GDPR is done through the data subject. So if we have 10 criteria\\nthat are elevating the risk to the data subject, then it\\'s very straightforward\\nfrom a GDPR perspective. On the systems within the AI\\nAct, they\\'re very specific. There\\'s a series of recitals at the end that give you an exact\\nlist, two pages long, of the systems that are\\ncategorized as high risk. So I just gave a couple of examples there, but there\\'s a whole list of them. So you don\\'t get to determine\\nif it\\'s high risk or not. The AI Act tells you\\nwhether it is or it isn\\'t, but outside of the AI Act, so in the US, you don\\'t have that. So how do we translate\\nthat into a set of criteria for you really, I don\\'t know. - In practice. Yeah.\\n- Yeah. I don\\'t know the answer to that. - [Attendee 4] Well,\\nyeah, thank you so much. - [Dr. Lyons] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Welcome. It did, I don\\'t\\nknow if you read it. Welcome everybody, I hope\\nyou have enjoyed RSA so far, and continue to enjoy it\\nafter hearing me talk about crypto forums for 40 minutes,\\nwhich seems like a lot. And yet, somehow is not nearly enough. Here is RSA\\'s disclaimer, I\\'m\\nsure you\\'ve seen it a lot. They do not endorse anything\\nthat I say here today, probably a smart move. You\\'ll notice that I don\\'t\\nhave a similar disclaimer from the company that\\nI work for, Protect AI. I asked our head of marketing if she wanted me to include one, and she shrugged that she didn\\'t think so. So I\\'m not saying that I\\nrepresent Protect AI here today, but Protect AI isn\\'t saying that I don\\'t. So, now, let\\'s kick this off. I wanna start this presentation\\nthe way that I start every first date, with my list of no\\'s. No, this is not an\\nendorsement of cryptocurrency. Simply a look at a unique security culture amid immense risk, no. If I mention a specific project and it\\'s positive security\\nculture, it does not mean you should buy anything related to it. You will almost certainly lose money. No, just because I\\'m highlighting the positive security culture\\nwithin these crypto forums, does not mean that I am\\nendorsing these communities. They\\'re often littered with\\nsome questionable language, some casual misogyny, and homophobia. So, where my cryptocurrency\\nand NFT interest stems from is, I would say, pure middle child syndrome. My older sister got a\\njob at a crypto exchange, and would often be asked about\\nher job and the blockchain during family get togethers. And I, desiring to be\\nthe center of attention, wanted to be able to talk about it. And the brat in me needed\\nto know a little bit more than my older sister did. So I researched, read some books, watched YouTube videos on the blockchain, and developed enough of a foundation to impress my many\\ncousins and grandparents, which surprisingly didn\\'t take much. Those were the blissful days,\\nbefore I stumbled across this article in March of 2022\\nthat started this nightmare, A CNET post titled, \"People\\nSpent 9K on Pixelmon NFTs, Then They Saw the Art,\"\\nby Daniel Van Boom, which, as a side note, is a kick\\nname if I\\'ve ever heard one. This whole article is a\\ngem, and I really recommend reading it and Van Boom\\'s other articles. Basically what happened is that people bet anywhere from seven to $9,000 per NFT, that an individual\\npseudonymously known as Cyber would be able to build a\\ntriple A open world game that is a cross between\\n\"Avatar, the Last Airbender\" and a Pokemon type monster hunting game. Honestly, that\\'s a game\\nI would love to play. And a lot of people seem to agree with me, because Pixelmon raised $70 million. And for that 70 million, they expected art like this and got this. This appeared to be a\\nclassic NFT rug pull, which is the crypto term for a scam. The enigmatic Cyber turned\\nout to be a 21-year-old New Zealander who, and this may shock you, was not an experienced game developer. Because I enjoy a little\\nbit of Schadenfreude, and I wanted to see the\\npanic these crypto bros would surely be in seeing the result of their speculative investment. So I joined their Discord,\\npoked around a bit, and had some fun at the fact\\nthat the ugliest character, actually called Kevin,\\nthe voxel zombie character you see on the right, became\\na meme in his own right. And spawned off his own\\ncash-grab NFT projects that celebrated his hideousness. Right after the art reveal,\\nwhich I have privately called the Kevining, all other\\nPixelmon were valued at around $1,500, while Kevin was 13,000. All of which is to say that\\nwhere value comes from in crypto is hard to predict. So I had my fun, enjoyed some laughs at the expense of other people. Texted my sister this story, because she would get kicked out of it, and then I didn\\'t think about it again. But I made a critical mistake there, I stayed in the Discord server and I kept seeing the little\\nred alert flags in Discord signaling announcements being made, which the curious part of\\nme needed to investigate. So when I started to see\\nnotifications pop up in my sidebar, I would scroll through the\\nupdates and the messages of the people committed to this project. And I began to notice something that I think is kind of incredible. This is a community that is\\nwilling to gamble and invest unbelievable sums of\\nmoney on digital assets, digital assets that I\\nfrankly cannot differentiate, and I doubt you can either. On the screen here, you\\nwill see two different NFTs. One of them was purchased at 4,000, the other at 23.7 million. Can you tell me which is which? I\\'ll give you a hint, one\\nof them is a crypto punk, one of the original NFT projects. In crypto terms, it is\\nancient because it was created in the distant year of 2017. The other is called a crypto\\nphunk, spelled with a P-H, which is a derivative copy\\nof the massively popular crypto funks that is\\nidentical in every way, except the icons face\\na different direction. As far as I can tell,\\ncrypto funk doesn\\'t provide any utility, they are\\nsimply a collector\\'s item. Fun fact, if you don\\'t\\nagree to the crypto punk website\\'s terms and conditions\\nand indemnity statements, you are automatically\\nrouted to the eBay page for the original Beanie Babies,\\nwhich feels rather telling. If, for whatever reason, you wanted to own a crypto punk today, it would\\ncost you around $122,000 last time I checked. Whereas an entry level crypto phunk, again, P-H, will run you around $450. I\\'ll stop keeping you in\\nsuspense, I know you\\'re curious. The one worth 23 million is\\nobviously the one on the left. I think, I\\'m gonna... Was it the one on the right? No, it\\'s definitely, that\\'s the one that\\'s worth $23 million. Not that one, that one. All of this is to say that to\\nmake money in the crypto space is often a crapshoot. And this is the type of\\nrisk that crypto enthusiasts willingly jump into,\\nspending hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands on extremely\\nspeculative investments based on little more than gut instinct. So when I tell you that outside\\nof the people in this room and at this conference, the\\npeople with crypto assets have the most honed risk\\nmanagement instincts when it comes to information security, believe me when I\\nunderstand your skepticism. In order to convince you of this thesis, let\\'s start with the stakes. This is a conversation that I witnessed in real-time as it unfolded. Someone got drained, or\\nmaybe a listing error drained an active community member. You\\'ll notice in the screenshot provided that half a dozen NFTs were sold for less than a penny of Ethereum. This almost always means\\nthat a hacker got access to someone\\'s wallet, and\\nis selling those assets to themselves as a quick\\nway to transfer them before someone could regain\\ncontrol of their wallet. Within 11 minutes, our protagonist emerges and self-identifies with\\na simple \"Was me sadly.\" This reaction stuck\\nwith me, \"Was me sadly.\" The instant acceptance of the theft, to me that would mean not\\na lot of money was lost, but that didn\\'t sit right\\nbecause I knew the rough value of each of those NFTs. And it was likely that they had\\nother assets in that wallet. So I spent a whole Friday night,\\n\\'cause I know how to party, trawling through the blockchain\\nto see exactly what was lost and found that the scammer had\\nquickly sold every single NFT for $70,407 and 22 cents. Was me sadly was the reaction to the loss of $70,407 and 22 cents. $70,407 and 22 cents, for that amount of money,\\nyou can buy this charming five bed, three bath house in Oklahoma. For $70,407 and 22 cents, you can almost afford these vintage\\nAir Jordans off of eBay. Was me sadly is the response I would give if I lost $20 in the wash. Was me sadly didn\\'t even go through the five stages of grief,\\nthey flew right to acceptance. Where did this total acceptance\\ncome from? I had to know. So I bought one of these things. I dove in headfirst,\\neyes open, but headfirst. My dad gave me a strong sense\\nof fiscal responsibility, so I only invested money\\nI was able to lose. This is where I want to reiterate that no part of this\\npresentation is an endorsement of the industry of cryptocurrency. The choices I make, good or\\nbad, are what work for me. And what works for me is unlikely\\nto work for anybody else. I do not own a car, and\\nI still live with my mom. What works for me doesn\\'t\\nwork for everybody. But I felt that I could not\\ntruly understand was me sadly, unless I jumped into the\\necosystem like they did. And I desperately needed to\\nunderstand how they could react so nonchalantly to the loss of exactly $70,407 and 22 cents. Listen, I spent a whole Friday\\nnight, a whole Friday night doing the math on that. You had better believe I\\'m\\ngoing to say the precise number. It turns out the answer is simple. In the crypto space,\\nthere is no safety net. If you fall for a scam, who do you call? If your wallet gets drained, you are shit outta luck,\\nthe original title. It\\'s not like when your credit\\ncard number gets stolen, you\\'re suddenly on the hook\\nfor the thousands of dollars of V-bucks that the scammer buys. For those of you blissfully unaware, or doesn\\'t have younger\\nsiblings, V-bucks is the currency in the video game, \"Fortnite.\" When it comes to credit card fraud, you are only on the hook for about $50. And then for debit cards, as\\nlong as you report the fraud within 60 days, I don\\'t\\nbelieve you\\'re liable for any of the damages. But crypto is supposedly decentralized and largely unregulated,\\nthat is part of its appeal. So when you approve a malicious\\ntransaction, by design and the nature of the technology\\nused, there is no recourse. Technically, technically,\\nyou can report the theft to the FBI and you definitely should. But unless the scammer\\nmakes a critical error, your crypto and the money\\nassociated with it is long gone. Theft in the crypto space is the most hilarious kind of cruel. Because everything is\\npublic on the blockchain, you can view the exact moment\\nyour assets were stolen. You can see the wallet address\\nyour assets were moved to, you can see what it was sold\\nfor, and who is now the owner of what was your NFT. If you want it back, you\\nrely entirely on their mercy. It\\'s kind of like if you had video footage of a person stealing your wallet. The thief is holding your\\nwallet in front of you and waving it about,\\nyou point the thief out to a police officer while they\\'re still holding the wallet up in the air. But the police officer says\\nthere\\'s nothing they can do, because the perp holding\\nyour wallet super tight and they look really fast, so\\nit\\'s the thief\\'s wallet now. All the issues that we face\\nwith phishing in our jobs, the massive problem that is\\nthe human element in companies is exacerbated 1,000 fold in crypto. Offers that are too good to be true can be a little true\\nwhen it comes to crypto. People become overnight\\nmillionaires for no reason, seemingly overnight and every day. Who remembers Dogecoin,\\nwhen a bunch of people in their late teens and early 20s suddenly became millionaires for choosing the right dog-themed cryptocurrency? Grammar and spelling errors,\\nand names that are weird are generally an indicator\\nof a phishing email, but they\\'re practically a\\nstaple of the crypto space. Cabbage, Garlicoin,\\nHarryPotterObamaSonicInu, WhalePanda, Mafia Doge,\\nCoinye, Useless Ethereum Token. Can you tell me which\\none of these is made up? \\'Cause they\\'re all real. A sense of urgency, the kind that bypasses the critical thinking part of your brain, is a key part of the crypto ecosystem. In order to understand why\\nthe urgency is ingrained in crypto system, you have to\\nknow about the concept of gas. This is where we\\'re gonna\\nget very minorly technical. The ledger that is the\\nbackbone of the blockchain requires a lot of energy,\\nso the distributed network needs an incentive to\\nrecord the transactions. That is where gas comes in, gas is the price you pay per transaction. This price on major chains\\ngenerally ranges from a few bucks to hundreds of dollars. This price is dependent on\\nthe volume of transactions at that point in time. When you initiate a transaction, the rough price of gas is posed\\nto you and a timer begins. As you can see on the slide, this individual has only 36 seconds left to accept a gas price of $148, which may be a great deal for that day. Getting a great price\\non gas can be crucial, especially when you are\\nflipping a digital asset for a couple of bucks profit. So when you get a good price\\nand the timer starts ticking, you may choose to accept\\nit before you check the URL or wallet address you\\'re transacting with. When you start getting\\npulled into this community and joining or following crypto\\nprojects, you start getting DMs promising incredible\\nopportunities and free money. This is one that I found on\\nReddit, and it is my favorite. This Discord DM starts\\nvery enthusiastically. \"Congratulations, you\\'re\\none of the lucky winners of our giveaway.\" They, and by they, I mean\\nKFC, for some reason, is contacting this random\\nindividual to give away the crypto equivalent of $20,000. This whole screenshot is\\nperfect in its ridiculousness. And I don\\'t know what I like the best. Is it the fact that the\\nscammers are claiming to be from a fast food chicken restaurant? That they want you to click on a link that\\'s literally titled ethlegit.com? Maybe it\\'s the sentence\\ndown to the bottom? \"If you don\\'t know what\\ncryptocurrencies are, and how to use them, please\\nignore this message.\" So polite. But, again, crypto is\\nsometimes inherently silly. So why would you be more\\nsuspicious of this than Dogecoin, or use this Ethereum token? Maybe KFC is trying to\\nget in the crypto game. When I did decide to\\nfinally subject myself to this technology, the\\nfirst thing I had to do was choose an exchange. As you can see here, I chose Bittrex, it was the exchange my sister worked for. You may not have heard about it before, and that is because it\\ndoesn\\'t exist anymore. At least, the US version\\ndoesn\\'t exist anymore. Due to US law and know\\nyour customer regulations, you have to provide an\\nuncomfortable amount of information, way more than when you\\napply for a credit card. Not only did they ask for\\nmy Social Security number and bank information, they\\nneeded a copy of my passport and a 3D scan of my face. All information I am\\nsure this defunct company is keeping incredibly safe. Crypto exchanges collapse all the time, there is a whole Wikipedia\\npage dedicated to it. Some because of poor or\\nfraudulent management, most famously FTX, as I\\'m sure\\nyou\\'re seeing in the news. Others because they were a\\nPonzi schemes from the jump, like Celsius, allegedly. Or because the poorer\\nmanagement was so severe that the exchange was hacked and had customers\\' crypto\\nstolen, like Mt. Gox. Because of the fallibility\\nof these exchanges, a curious phrase has cropped\\nup in the crypto community, not your keys, not your crypto. Meaning if you do not have\\nthe seed phrase for the wallet your crypto rests in, you do\\nnot actually own that crypto. As a result, especially\\nafter the FTX crash, many people only keep crypto\\nor cash on these exchanges for as long as it takes to\\ndo a desired transaction. Then immediately transfer those assets to their own wallet or an actual bank. Exchanges know about this reputation loss that they have suffered\\nand offer insane incentives to keep your assets on their platform, like a 5% or higher APY on your idle cash. I love free money, I\\'m sure you do too. This is a tempting offer\\nthat is hard to resist, but many crypto enthusiasts\\nhave had to weigh that easy money against\\nthe safety of their assets. Unlike banks and stock\\nexchanges, crypto exchanges have no insurance like FDIC or SIPC. So when the exchange goes bust and your money is still\\nlocked in, you have to hope that it gets returned during\\nthe bankruptcy proceedings. Now, why did I include\\nthis email that I got? Because it\\'s a scam. After Bittrex went\\nbankrupt, many customers, myself included, got an email like this, which included accurate details from the bankruptcy proceedings. This is my full legal name. Outside of the DMV and\\nwhen I piss off my mother, I never see or hear this. I cannot tell you how jarring\\nit was to get an email like this and how convincing\\nit was, at least initially. Their major mistake for\\nme was saying that I had more than eight grand left on Bittrex. The idea that I would put eight\\ngrand in a crypto exchange is ludicrous, but this\\nis a fantastic phish. I cannot imagine how many\\npeople were hoodwinked by this campaign, or similar campaigns from other exchanges exploding which, again, happens rather frequently. Airdrops present the most bizarre and terrifying attack\\nsurface in the crypto space, at least in my opinion. Any person anywhere in the world can send a digital asset to your wallet. And because an interaction\\nwith a digital asset requires the signing of a contract, you can\\'t delete it either. All you can do is hide it, but it will continue\\nto exist in perpetuity. Here is an alert on a project\\nserver about an airdrop scam that many of their members received, clearly identifying it as a scam, which hopefully saved some\\nof their members some money. Now, before we move on, I wanna\\ntalk about a major concern that I have when it comes to NFT airdrops that I cannot believe isn\\'t\\nalready a major problem. I\\'ll quickly remind you that\\nan NFT airdrop is a picture that is sent to you, that\\nyou then actually own, that you can never get rid of. Otherwise, your assets might be stolen. What is to stop someone\\nfrom airdropping arrival an NFT of CSAM, child sexual\\nabuse material, as revenge? How has a much maligned crypto influencer not been pulled into a scandal\\nwhen a viewer that hates them drops a CSAM NFT into their public wallet? I expect this to become a major problem in the crypto community in\\nthe not too distant future. Outside of the awful criminal\\nimplications of NFT airdrops, CORN airdrops are often more convincing. Here is an airdrop of 11 billion SHIB, a real coin that exists. It\\'s kind of an offshoot of Dogecoin. Further down in the wallet,\\nit will actually link you to the real website for SHIB,\\nfurther legitimizing it. Thankfully, Coinbase has\\nimplemented a helpful little security feature that\\ncan help you suss out the scam. The banner at the top says that this is on the Gnosis network, rather than on Ethereum\\nwhere actual SHIB lives, which helps indicate that\\nyou should hide this asset rather than engage with it. But, again, because it was\\nairdropped into your wallet, you will never truly be rid of it. The temptation will always be there. I really wanna hammer home the insanity that is airdrop scams, so I came up with this analogy. Airdrops are like getting\\nthose hot singles in your area banner ads in your bank account, and being unable to ever remove that ad. Just a constant temptation and\\nthreat that looms over you, waiting for you to make a\\nmistake in a place where people will keep hundreds of\\nthousands of dollars of assets. Now, after all of this\\nresearch and digging, I thought I understood was me sadly and their motivations, I really did. But I didn\\'t at all, until\\nsomething awful happened. The line went up. By that, I mean the NFT I bought suddenly became worth vastly\\nmore than I bought it for. And I briefly, briefly\\nlost my sense of reason, and I started to feel\\nthe anxious excitement I think people feel when\\nthey win at a slot machine. I started questioning\\nwhy my NFT was suddenly worth so much money. And instead of immediately\\nthinking about cashing out, my mind wondered if I should hold longer and see if the line\\nwill go up even further. The fomo, fear of missing out, of missing out on larger gains instantly, instantly invaded my mind. God, what a crazy thought, since I could not understand\\nthe value to begin with. Then I started to worry that\\nthis was somehow a scam offer, that the exchange I used had been hacked and hadn\\'t been announced. This was both a reasonable\\nand an unreasonable fear, entirely driven by the\\nfact that if I signed this digital contract\\nand I was wrong about the authenticity, I would\\nlose everything in my wallet. And have nothing to do, but to accept it, like was me sadly did. Eventually, I breathed through my anxiety, scolded my brain for thinking\\nabout that I should wait for a higher offer, and sold the NFT. Now, it wasn\\'t Oklahoma house money, let alone vintage Jordan\\nmoney, wasn\\'t even car money. What it was, was Vespa money. Used Vespa money, but still Vespa money. Now, I know, I know I\\nshouldn\\'t get a Vespa. I live on a mountain,\\nSeattle rains all the time, but I can\\'t help but want\\none, I want one so bad. In my first draft, I had a long paragraph about exactly how many nodes\\nwere in this transaction, and how many hoops I had to jump through in order to turn an NFT into dollars. But I realized that that\\nwas not what was important, what was important was\\nthis whole experience and how it made me feel. I bought that NFT with\\nmoney I was willing to lose, without expectation of a return. The second it held actual value to me, I became terrified to lose it. It didn\\'t matter that I didn\\'t\\nagree with the valuation, suddenly I felt entitled to it. And the knowledge that any\\nmistake meant losing it, and that there are no\\ndo-overs was agonizing. Every time I had to sign\\na wallet transaction, I held my breath because\\neven though I had no reason to believe otherwise, I wasn\\'t 100% sure I wasn\\'t screwing up. All people with experience\\nin crypto live with the same assumed breach mindset many\\ncybersecurity professionals do, just without any hope of recovery. So how has the crypto community\\nresponded to the elements of crypto that is trying\\nto make them fail? I see a sentiment of zero trust\\nmore often in crypto forums than I do anywhere else outside of pure cybersecurity circles. This is an exchange that follows\\nafter someone writes about how they got DM\\'d to sell a digital asset on a less reputable exchange. My favorite line is, \"If there\\'s\\none thing you can\\'t trust in Web3, it\\'s everyone.\" I agree 100%, it is how\\nI wish everyone felt about every interaction\\nthey had on the web. When it comes to security\\nand personal risk assessment, crypto enthusiasts have one\\nof the strongest communities I have ever seen. Every Discord you join\\nis gonna have a channel that is strictly dedicated\\nto scams and security alerts. Some are better than others, of course, but there is an expectation\\nwithin the community that these channels will exist. Take this one for instance, posted in the Security Alert\\nchannel that lets people know that wallet drainer links can be easily hidden in Discord links, which is a fantastic security alert to send out to your community. It is a perfect encapsulation of how solid the security community is here. And alerts, the alerts\\nthat people are sharing are incredibly relevant\\nand community generated. These aren\\'t CVs spread by CISA to alert about critical volumes. There is no official central\\nagency keeping you up to date about the new dangers in crypto. This is something a person noticed, that they posted on Twitter,\\nthat then gets forwarded on to everyone else who could be affected. \"Watch out for these hidden reward sites, I have seen this scam\\nmore often these days.\" This is a helpful and clear\\nsecurity alert from this team. I can imagine posting something\\nsimilar to the company Slack if I saw a persistent and emerging threat. Even outside of security alert,\\nthe security alert channel, which is generally run by the project, you\\'ll see individual users post about unique security concerns\\nthat they have seen crop up. Like this tweet, which\\ngot 1.5 million views, letting people know that NFT\\nTrader had been compromised and is being actively exploited. And that if you have a live connection, you need to revoke it immediately. A very helpful tip from\\na crypto compatriot. There are no stupid questions in crypto, because crypto itself feels\\ninherently rather silly. So if you are ever worried that you\\'re about to\\nmake a foolish choice, you have easy access to a\\ngroup of like-minded people you can run your worries by. In this example, this\\nperson wanted to know if this random airdrop they\\nreceived in their wallet, that they were being offered $583 for, is a legit offer or a scam. They are immediately told,\\nliterally within seconds, 4:05 to 4:05, that this is a scam, and nobody sends you free NFTs ever. Which is generally true,\\nI\\'m not gonna quibble over it right now, but\\nit\\'s generally true. The projects themselves are huge targets for malicious actors, and\\nyou\\'ll see project Discords, websites, and Twitter\\naccounts hacked quite often. This happens with such frequency, that when there\\'s a\\nsudden shift in messaging, people know to automatically\\nquestion its authenticity. Such as when Munchables was hacked, and at least $62.5 million was stolen. Pixelmon, the project that\\nstarted all this craziness, was hacked and both its project and CEO\\'s Twitter were compromised. This hack was noticed by a\\nnormal user within 50 seconds, and communicated throughout the community. This quick action kept\\npeople from interacting with a wallet drainer and, as a result, no one within the Discord\\ncommunity got hacked. Can you imagine how incredible it would be if one of our\\ncompanies was breached, and started sending out\\nabnormal emails or tweets, and your customers and employees\\nwere primed to recognize the signs of malicious\\nactors, and were able to alert your security team within a\\nminute of the attack going live? I mean, I still cannot believe\\nthe swiftness of the action of normal users within this community. This person took a\\nscreenshot within 50 seconds of the post going live. And as soon as the screenshot\\nwas seen within the Discord, someone else recognized\\nthat they needed to ping an actual member of the product team. They then go on to talk\\nabout the other indicators that show that this is\\nnot an official tweet, such as the comments being locked. Frankly, I am a little jealous of the speed of this response. When you join a project Discord server, you have to agree to a set of rules. My favorite one pictured\\nhere is from Azuki. As you can see, of the seven\\nrules you must agree to, arguably four, of the seven\\nrules you must agree to, you are focused on not getting scammed. The others can kind of be boiled down into not being allowed to be creepy, which I think are also\\na good set of rules. But the security rules\\nare simple and effective. Number one, keep your\\ndirect messages closed, with four exclamation points\\nso you know they mean it. No team member or bot will ever DM you. Next, any announcement or links sent through a DM is a scam. Please do not click or mint anything outside of our official channels. And the last one, help educate others about how to avoid getting scammed. This last one is my favorite, and it makes it abundantly\\nclear from the moment you join a project that\\nit is your responsibility and the responsibility of everyone else in the community to help\\nand protect each other and the project from scams. In crypto, security is a community effort. Every time a project or a\\nwell gets hacked or scammed, it makes the whole system look bad. These projects even do checks\\non your personal settings, to make sure that you are\\nbeing as secure as possible. Security is not just a\\npersonal responsibility, as it can often be treated\\nby many SaaS companies. When I received this message\\nfrom one of the projects I joined, I was kind of astounded. Even though they reached out\\nwith the humorous tagline, \"You\\'re a lizard, Larry,\"\\nwhich I kind of secretly love, they let me know that the dummy account I created was not secure. And that I should make sure my\\nDMs are off for my security. Many companies have free\\nfeatures and programs you can enable to increase your security. What comes to mind instantly for me is Google Advanced Protection. But you have to know about\\nthem or go searching for them before you can utilize them. I would love it if a\\ncommunity reached out to me, recognizing that I am at an\\nincreased risk for scams, and gave me simple steps on\\nhow I can be more secure. So now, you\\'ve learned way more than you would want about cryptocurrency and the community revolving around it. And you\\'re probably thinking to yourself, this is the best presentation\\nI\\'ve seen all week, what am I supposed to\\ndo with this info dump? Well, what I\\'m not arguing\\nis that you should start paying out bonuses in crypto\\nto force your employees to get better at\\nunderstanding risk management. It would definitely work,\\nbut you shouldn\\'t do it. What I am saying is, if this ragtag group of degenerate gamblers\\ncan form a tight-knit security community based on mutual risk, then why can\\'t we do the\\nsame within our companies? At Protect AI, I have\\nimplemented some of these ideas. Making security accessible,\\nby being a visible and inviting person that\\nis easy to reach out to, and generally quick to respond. If someone has a question,\\nsecurity related or not, I encourage them to talk to me. I find that if people are\\ncomfortable coming to me with questions that they\\nthink I might find silly, then I can often uncover some more pressing security details,\\nor to just develop a positive relationship with them, which is always a good thing. Stated simply, if people feel\\nlike they can ask questions without being judged, they will ultimately ask more questions and take\\nfewer unnecessary risks. When onboarding new\\nemployees, I talk about why security\\'s important at Protect AI, and what our no safety net is. I then work with them\\nthrough the easy steps to be more secure in what anybody can do. And when they\\'re not sure what\\nthey\\'re supposed to be doing, they\\'re absolutely\\nencouraged to reach out. For Protect AI, our no\\nsafety net is the fact that we are fundamentally\\na security company. So a massive breach, and\\na poor response to it, could be a business killing risk, which obviously none of\\nus at Protect AI want. Without naming names,\\nI\\'m sure everyone here can remember a company that had a breach and a terrible recovery. And when you were considering\\nvendors in that space, you probably discounted them\\nbecause of their reputation. I don\\'t tell new employees this with the intent to scare\\nthem, but I have always felt that when people are armed with knowledge, they act like soldiers. Reputation is critical\\nin the crypto space, and many projects respond accordingly. Reputation is critical\\nin security businesses, so Protect AI will respond\\naccordingly as well. Security needs to be a\\nfront-facing part of the company in order to make security accessible, and to have the opportunity\\nto demonstrate how simple some of the solutions can sometimes be. At Protect AI, something\\nas simple as having a five minute security\\nsnack bite presentation during the all hands meeting allows me to be in front of the\\nwhole company regularly to communicate and give\\nhelpful, easy security tips. Like, being mindful of your surroundings when you\\'re working in public,\\nwhich was important for RSA. Or to update all of the\\ndevices that they own, regardless if it\\'s a\\ncompany device or not, whenever the update is available, because it\\'s an easy security\\nwin and automatically fixes known security vulnerabilities. Lastly, we need to embrace\\nrecovery and prepare for it. The aspect that makes the\\ncryptocurrency community so compelling to me is the fatalism that encompasses the technology. You make a mistake, you have a breach, you are shit outta luck because\\nthere is nothing you can do. No preparations you could\\nhave done beforehand to recover your digital\\nassets from being stolen. If there was a way for crypto\\nbros to back up their assets to recover even a fraction of\\nwhat they lost after a scam, they would do so without hesitation. Let\\'s learn from their\\npain, and take advantage of the recovery and incident\\nresponse tools we have. Nope, nope. Now, even if you don\\'t agree with me, prepare for more people who learned security and risk tolerance\\nand earned a great deal of paranoia by going\\nthrough the crypto gauntlet. Like this person, who commented on the was me sadly slide,\\n\"I hate scammers, man.\" \"One reason I\\'m studying cyber.\" Thank you, we\\'re done. (audience applauding) Now, I\\'m open to any\\nquestions, but I also know this was a weird one. So if you have no follow up\\nquestions, I totally understand. - [Audience Member] I just\\nhave a quick question. - [Rachel] Yeah, what\\'s up?\\n- Can you explain airdropping a little bit more, like how that works, and what the end goal is? Are they trying to steal\\nyour cryptocurrency or plant malware, or what\\'s the goal? - [Rachel] Yeah, no, so, I mean, there can be multiple goals. I mean, I outlined one\\nthat I have a concern of, which is just like having the\\nthing that\\'s in your wallet. But different networks\\nhave different gas fees, so the ones that are really\\ncheap are usually the ones that the airdrops scams come from. So you\\'ll get an airdrop into your wallet, that the person who airdropped\\nit in paid pennies for. And they\\'re hoping that if\\nthey offer you enough money on the exchange on the\\nother end, you\\'ll say, \"Oh, wonderful, $500 for this thing that showed up into my wallet.\" You click and sign the transaction, \\'cause every interaction\\nyou have with your wallet requires like a digital signature. And most people don\\'t actually read the contracts that they\\'re signing. And it will give that person, the hacker, permission to transfer all\\nthe assets outta their wallet. So just, the goal is to get them to sign a contract that is malicious. All right, I think that\\'s it. Thank you very, very much for\\ncoming. Feel free to review. - [Host] Thank you Rachel, thank you. If you have any other questions, you can step outside.\\n- [Rachel] Yeah.', 'drive': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QIXHuQx8ZMgaNJrQE9IaR-YusCk2GcKt'}, {'url': 'https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2024/employee%20of%20the%20month%20to%20insider%20malfeasance', 'title': 'Employee of the Month to Insider Malfeasance', 'date': 'May 09, 2024', 'text': 'Explore the journey from trusted employee to fraudster.

Thanks for joining me. I know it\\'s like lunch hour,\\nthe last day of the conference, so I appreciate you coming\\nand spending some time with me as we talk about the topic, kind of fraud and insider threats. My name\\'s Aaron Reyes, I\\'m a\\nManaging Director at Crowe. 18 years of experience doing digital forensics\\nand investigations. Typically, when I speak at a conference on very technical things such\\nas mobile device forensics, cloud forensics, investigating\\nOffice 365, or Google Cloud, investigating social media activity. But what I found is those presentations tend to not age very well. Either the underlying technology changes or the tools I\\'m explaining\\nand talking about change. And so six months later,\\nthey\\'re kind of irrelevant. What I was hoping to do is\\npackage up a presentation that\\'s gonna have a\\nlittle bit more longevity. Obviously, the thing to talk about at a conference these days\\nwould be machine learning and artificial intelligence, but I wanted to relate it\\nback to some case studies that I\\'ve had in my career and\\nsome themes that I\\'ve seen. So I wanna talk about those case studies, tie in some statistics that I\\'ve seen are related to those\\ncase studies and fraud, and then give you a\\ntakeaway on how to apply a fraud prevention checklist. If I can figure out the clicker. Great. So, of course, I\\'m obligated\\nto show the disclaimer here. I think probably\\neveryone\\'s presenting this and all their presentations, but just in terms of use on what you can and can\\'t do with the presentation today. The topic here is really framed around kind of the scenario of\\nemployee of the month or somebody who\\'s very well\\nrespected in the company, maybe been with the company a long time, or has a unique role with\\na lot of authority, right? So we\\'re gonna frame our discussion and case studies around that. One example. I actually created this slide\\ndeck many months ago, right? And there\\'s something recent in the news that popped up just yesterday, it was related to something in baseball, and I love baseball, and it\\'s\\nrelated to Shohei Ohtani. Anyone know who that is, right. And where the guy that San\\nFrancisco had, I was gonna say, we\\'re in San Francisco\\nso we can talk about the Dodgers in a certain\\nway here. (laughs) So he has been in the news lately because he has an interpreter that had some gambling\\ndebts and problems, right? He, just today, just yesterday, has struck a deal, a plea deal. So he\\'ll be pleading\\nguilty to something like 16 to $17 million of in\\nfraud banking transactions. So just as I\\'m preparing for\\nthe presentation, that pops up. And, of course, I\\'m a big baseball fan. I\\'m taking my son and my family\\nto see the Savannah Bananas. Has anyone heard of the Savannah Bananas? They\\'re coming to Sacramento. We have a minor league\\nbaseball team in Sacramento called the River Cats. So I\\'m super pumped to go see them. If you don\\'t know who they are, they\\'re kind of like the Harlem\\nGlobe Trotters for Baseball. They put on a fantastic show. So highly recommend you go\\ncheck them out if you can. But I just thought it was\\nreally timely to the discussion we\\'ll be having today, because\\nI actually put this slide up, created that slide many months ago before hearing about the scandal. And it\\'s almost about,\\nin this example here, for the same amount of funds stolen by the interpreter for Shohei. I\\'m gonna try to get the\\nname, Ippei Mizuhara, I think is the name of the interpreter. So this is in my cases that\\nI\\'ve worked in my career, the typical scenario is you\\nhave this trusted employee kind of unmonitored, but really has a lot of keys to the\\nkingdom in the organization. Something happens and the\\nresult is a headline in the news about somebody stealing funds. So you hear about it all the time. So for a case example, I\\'m gonna dive into actual case examples. And the first one involves,\\nit\\'s car dealership. So nothing unusual, nothing nefarious. There\\'s no foul play at car\\ndealerships, right? (laughs) I think if you\\'ve ever purchased a car, you felt like you were getting fleeced or stolen from right in the process. So the backstory to this is have a family owned car\\ndealership doing really well. It\\'s run by the father, the\\npatriarch of the family. They also have a son and two daughters. There\\'s one younger\\ndaughter, she\\'s an adult, but she\\'s really inexperienced. She kind of helps out at the front office and helps in the reception area. So the dealership is doing\\nwell, they\\'re expanding, sales are really good. And unfortunately, the father\\npasses away unexpectedly. And the son and the two daughters, they wanna continue their family\\'s legacy and they jump in, and the son\\nbecomes the general manager for the dealership, and the\\nolder daughter becomes the CFO, and the younger daughter\\ncontinues to kind of manage the front office, desk stuff,\\nand the reception area. So things are really going well for them. They continue, even though they\\'re dealing with the loss of their father, things are progressing, sales are doing really well,\\nactually, they\\'re increasing. And what\\'s not increasing\\nis their cash flow and their bank reserves. And so the new general manager, the son, is looking at the cash\\nflow for the company and saying, \"We\\'re gonna\\nrun outta cash pretty soon, but that doesn\\'t make sense because our sales are\\nincreasing month after month, what\\'s going on?\" And so it\\'s concern there that he\\'s gonna be outta\\nbusiness pretty soon if this continues. He\\'s also noticing that the sister is behaving differently now. She\\'s actually living a more\\nlavish lifestyle, right? She\\'s going on vacations, lavish. And so this is really frustrating. The older brother, like,\\n\"What the heck\\'s going on?\" He brings in his attorney\\nwho brings our team in to kind of figure out\\nwhat\\'s going on with, is it just some banking irregularities? Some, you know, something\\nfell through the cracks too when the father passed away. And so we start digging\\nin, and here\\'s where I\\'m gonna bake in some\\nof the technology piece. So they don\\'t want to tip off the sister of what\\'s the investigation\\nhas kicked off. So they ask us to come in and do digital forensics\\nin a covert way, right? So we come in after hours\\nand when she\\'s not around, she\\'s probably on vacation\\nand we take her computer \\'cause she doesn\\'t take it with her, she leaves it at the office, and we take out the hard drive, we plug it into our\\nforensic imaging device. You plug the hard drive, the\\nsource drive into one side and a destination drive on\\nthe other, run the command, it creates a forensic image. It\\'s kinda like a DD image, and it gets encapsulated\\nwith some metadata and some verification information. And so we have that going. We\\'re also digging into their ERP and their financial systems, pulling reports out of transaction, what the heck\\'s going on? So those two tracks are\\nhappening simultaneously. And what... Let me get some water. (chuckles) And what happened is we\\nsee some irregularities in the payroll transactions. We\\'re actually seeing double. We\\'re seeing two transactions\\nfor every pay period, and so that\\'s odd. We asked some questions about that. Why would it be structured in such a way? We can see in the first\\npayroll transaction that employees are getting paid, everything looks fine and\\nthe payment\\'s going to ADP and the second transaction... Can anyone guess where the\\nfunds are being directed? Anybody? What\\'s that? (participant speaking faintly) - [Aaron Reyes] (laughs)\\nThat\\'s absolutely right. It\\'s going directly to the\\ndaughter\\'s personal bank account. So sir, I have a challenge coin for you, sorry about the toss. And that is from a challenge coin. I\\'m a board member for the HTCIA, High Tech Crimes\\nInvestigators Association, so that\\'s on behalf of HTCIA, thanks, Northern California chapter. And so lo and behold, it\\'s going right to the daughter\\'s personal bank account. So she\\'s immediately fired\\nand everyone\\'s kind of, you know, feeling down,\\nthey\\'ve lost the father, passed away, now the\\ndaughter\\'s on bad terms and out of the company and\\nour forensic accounting team continues just to look over transactions and they notice something\\nelse related to a transaction related to the younger\\ndaughter\\'s boyfriend. And he has a car that he bought through the dealership and has a loan, and that loan got written off. It was performing well, the\\npayments had been up to date and they wrote off the loan. And so, essentially, the boyfriend got a free car out of the deal. And so, we looked into that. That was not approved by the father before his passing or anything. And so the fortunate story\\nhere is that, you know, instead of continuing\\non their family\\'s legacy and building this family owned business, it kind of fell apart\\nand left to the older son to keep it going. So you can see these\\nreally trusted individuals, the trust that you can get, right? They\\'re family members, it can happen. So on the next case study\\nI wanna talk about here is related to a media company, and it\\'s actually a radio station. And the way it\\'s structured is\\nthat there\\'s a parent company that owns the radio station\\nand that parent company owns a lot of other\\nmedia companies as well. So the focus here is on the radio station. And in the radio station, there\\'s a lot of big\\npersonalities on the radio, but also in the executive function. So what occurs is the vendors\\nfor the radio station, they start to call and say they haven\\'t been getting paid, right? And it gets to the point where\\nit actually gets reported up to the parent company that the payments haven\\'t been flowing. And so the counsel for the parent company called us in and asked, \"We don\\'t know what the heck\\'s going on at the radio station. We need you to figure it out. But you know, again, don\\'t tip people off. Don\\'t make people worry\\nthat there\\'s this huge audit or investigation going on.\" So they asked us to do\\nsome remote imaging. What we do is we send a\\ncomputer that we can VPN into and attach a lot of storage, and then we\\'ll initiate\\nimaging of the devices on the network over the network, right? So they don\\'t know what\\'s going on, we just need admin credentials and we can connect our\\nimaging software up to them and start imaging devices. That\\'s going great. So then at the same time,\\nour financial accounting team is digging into the banking transactions. So they\\'re pulling information\\noutta the financial system and logging into the banks\\nand seeing what\\'s going on. The financial team,\\nfinancial forensic auditors find that the bank account is overdrawn and it\\'s overdrawn by $700,000. And I didn\\'t know an account\\ncould be overdrawn by $700,000. So it was quite a surprise to everyone and set off a bunch of alarms like, \"What the heck is going on?\" So we were asked to\\ninterview the executive at the radio station and\\nhe\\'s given us the runaround. He doesn\\'t know what we know\\nabout the $700,000 missing, but he says, \"Oh, you know what? That\\'s not a problem. It\\'s\\nactually just a timing issue. When the vendors submit their invoice, we have to route it to the parent company and then the parent company\\nsends back the payment. So it\\'s really, as soon\\nas we get the payment and get it processed through accounting, it\\'ll be no problem.\" We know that\\'s not the case, right? That funds are gone. And when we start digging\\ninto what\\'s going on, the executive had been running\\nall of his personal purchases through the company\\'s credit cards, and those credit cards are\\nbeing paid by the organization. So he has a really\\ngreat slush fund set up, but he\\'s quickly draining\\nall the funds available. One interesting thing he\\'s asked, he\\'s asked the accounting\\nfunction to book these personal expenses as\\nassets to the company. So all of a sudden the books and records for the organization are\\nalso being manipulated. And so what we also found is\\nthat it didn\\'t stop there, there was actually... The executive had given\\nhimself pay advances. So (laughs) he was getting\\npaid all this money up front and also running all his personal expenses through the corporate account. Now, the parent company steps in, makes all the vendors whole\\nso they don\\'t get sued and fire this individual and\\nbring charges against him. And so the lengthy\\nlitigation goes into play, but he actually ends up\\nhaving to serve time, I think 18 months in jail. So there\\'s some huge\\nbreakdown there between what\\'s going on with the radio station and what\\'s going on at the parent company. There\\'s not, there\\'s\\nbasically no oversight by the parent company and\\nthey\\'re not reconciling credit card statements. The accounting function was just blindly booking these entries and\\nhe had no oversight, right? So huge lack of oversight\\nin this case study. Let\\'s see, the next one I wanna talk about is related to a school district. And you can see here on the\\nscreen where it looks like something going on with cryptocurrency. So what happened was the\\nschool district officials were tipped off by a whistleblower that there was something going on in the server room of the school district. Now there wasn\\'t a lot\\nof details provided. They just wanted to whistle blow just enough to get some attention, but didn\\'t want to get involved in providing too many details initially. So the school officials\\ncontact their attorneys and their attorneys ask us to come in, and again, they want\\nus to come in covertly because they don\\'t want the server, the IT personnel might be\\ninvolved in what\\'s happening so they wanna take precaution. So they ask us, \"Come at nine o\\'clock, everyone should be gone, 9:00\\nPM, everyone should be gone and I\\'ll sneak you into the server room.\" And I don\\'t know exactly what to expect. They just kind of said there\\'s something, some odd equipment in the server room. So I\\'m walking in, I have\\nmy imaging equipment, all these bags, cables, keyboard, mice, you know, and monitors. I don\\'t know what to expect, but I kind of have to do it in one shot. Come walking up, opens the door as I\\'m coming in, like,\\n\"Come in, come in.\" \"Okay, what the heck\\'s going on?\" (laughs) And he goes, \"Let\\'s go,\\nlet\\'s go over here,\" and kind of like to that door right there. \"Let\\'s go, let\\'s go. Wait, hold on. I see somebody. Go back, go back. Oh, nevermind, it\\'s just the\\njanitor. Come on, come on.\" So he takes me over to the\\nserver room, badges me in, closes the door behind me, and kind of whispers, \"Text\\nme if you need anything,\" you know, (laughs) \"I\\'ll be in my office.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" So I\\'m walking in, it\\'s\\nkind of a tight server room. It\\'s not a huge one,\\nbut not a closet either. There\\'s virtually nowhere\\nto put any of my equipment. I\\'m looking for places to put power cords and things like that. And there\\'s the networking\\nrack, two server racks, and I do see on the ground there\\'s some unusual looking equipment sitting on the ground in the corner. And so this one stuck\\nout like a sore thumb. It looked like gaming machines, right? And gaming machines typically aren\\'t sitting in a server room. Somebody\\'s using \\'em to game normally. So I\\'m trying to figure\\nout what to do with \\'em. One of \\'em has a monitor\\nhooked up and a keyboard, no mouse to it. I go up to the machine and on the screen it says something minor\\nin the version like, \"Oh, okay, I see what\\'s going on here.\" Now I need to somehow figure out how to get the evidence off this machine, but I\\'m really worried\\nif I take it offline, it\\'s gonna notify somebody\\nthat it\\'s gone offline and we don\\'t wanna do that yet. So it\\'s running Linux,\\nso I format my hard drive and I load up a FTK imager,\\nforensic imaging utility that runs on Linux from the command line and was able to get the hard\\ndrive mounted in the system \\'cause it was actually\\nlogged in and mounted it up, kicked off the imaging of, I\\nthink there was four towers and on one of the towers\\nI can actually see inside. And it had all these flashing\\nneon lights going and fans but it was stacked with graphics cards. So that\\'s going, I\\'m trying\\nto get the heck outta there. I don\\'t wanna be there all night and gotta do documentation\\nas well, taking pictures and recording video, kind of\\nnarrating what I\\'m seeing, kind of trying to assess\\nthe extent of what\\'s here. So it finishes up pretty fast. Only issue was the system was\\nactually booted off a little USB thumb drives that was really slow. It was trying to image these\\ndrives and the imaging process when you do forensic imaging is you don\\'t just copy the active files, you copy all every sector of the disc \\'cause you might be able to recover some data if it\\'s been deleted. So it takes a long time even\\nthough there\\'s not a lot there. And so I get that, say I got, I think it\\'ll be done in about an hour. So sure enough, it finishes\\nup in like 45 minutes, take it back to our lab in\\nSacramento and start processing. And by that time, it\\'s almost midnight and I\\'m not gonna stay there. So I go home while it\\'s processing, and when I wake up in the\\nmorning, it\\'s done processing, I can start searching and I could see that he had been mining\\nfor about 18 months, year and a half, but had\\nrecently stopped mining. And I was like, \"Oh, that\\'s interesting.\" And I started to kind of\\nrecall what I was seeing. It was like, yeah, those\\nmachines actually were, didn\\'t seem be working too hard. There was neon lights going, but usually a mining rig will have a lot of fan action, it\\nwould be pretty noisy. So I was like, \"Okay, yeah,\\nI guess it wasn\\'t really, didn\\'t seem like it\\nwas working that hard.\" Well, I looked at the\\nwallet it was mining too, and I looked it up on the blockchain, and it had stopped\\nmining several months ago and the mining funds had stopped coming from the mining pool. And it\\'s like, \"Oh, that\\'s interesting.\" And the timing kind of\\ncorrelated with when he said it switched from proof of\\nwork to proof of stake, right? So they changed our\\nalgorithm to make mining not earn coin or earn\\nEthereum for the miners. So, they stopped mining and they left them there for some reason. And I could see how\\nmuch they had tallied up from the mining pool. I think it was something like\\n50 grand during that time, not too bad, but also not a huge amount. So what was also concerning\\nis using public funds or school district funds to make the purchase for those equipment. So we started to look\\ninto that and sure enough, we find that all that equipment had been purchased with public funds. So big problem for the IT director and the chief business officer\\nwho were involved in this. And another issue was we found that they had set up fictitious\\nvendors in the system. So now our accounting\\nteam\\'s getting honed in on what\\'s going on. And they found that fictitious vendors had been set up for the school district, and they were making payments\\nto these fictitious vendors and the funds were going\\nback to them, right? And to the tune of over $2 million. So that was where the real big hit came in and said, \"Okay, these guys are busted.\" And it starts to make sense, right? This guy, he\\'s known\\nfor having sports cars and being a sports car fanatic,\\nthe chief business officer, he has a Ferrari. (laughs) That was a good... and I actually like, you know,\\n\"He has a Ferrari, right?\" He goes, \"Oh yeah, he\\'s into cars.\" But I think what he\\ndoes is he purchase them with friends, other enthusiast\\nto make the purchase of a Ferrari saying, \"Oh, okay.\" (laughs) Well, turns out he was\\nactually just stealing from the school district\\nand buying himself a Ferrari and hoping no one would\\nconnect the dots there. So, we kind of do our\\npart, package up a report, handed over to the FBI and\\nwe stepped back for a while and months go by, I\\'m having\\ndinner with the attorney again. \"Oh, there\\'s been an update in that case and they\\'ve pled guilty\\nto stealing that money.\" And a week later, it\\'s out in the news, the DOJ has it on their\\nwebsite that that happened, this mining operation and\\nstealing of school district funds. So that was fun for me to kind of go in the middle of the night. The next one is related\\nto a really nice old lady and she owns a ranch\\nand she owns properties, she has lots of investments\\nso she\\'s set up really well. She loves to enter her horses\\ninto equestrian contest and she has ribbons all over. So six months ago, I think\\nlike four to six months prior, their bookkeeper had been let go. And the new bookkeeper came\\nin when they finally found one and started finding so many irregularities in their accounting system. And that\\'s when they brought\\nus in, the attorneys, local attorneys asked\\nus to come take a look and collect the evidence,\\npreserve the evidence because they know something\\'s going on, and they send me out there and I\\'m walking in the door\\nagain with all my gear. This time her house is\\ntheir office, right? And I got dogs jumping up on me when I\\'m trying to walk through, the house smells like Marlboros, and I go, \"Where\\'s the computer?\" I like, \"Hope I\\'m not\\nhere very long.\" (laughs) So, and \"Oh, it\\'s down\\nthe office corner there.\" And I go, \"Okay, great. I go in there again, it\\'s super cramped, and I\\'m trying to get all\\nmy imaging equipment out. I see a computer, that\\'s\\nthe QuickBooks computer. Also, while I\\'m there asking, \"Do you have any devices\\nlike text messages or, you know, other\\ncommunication devices?\" And they have two, one\\'s\\nthe more current one for the previous bookkeeper, and then a really old one\\nfor the previous bookkeeper, they didn\\'t have the pin code for that. So imageless devices using Cellebrite and then they say, \"Oh, by the way, the owner, the old nice old lady, she has a computer in her\\noffice that she uses.\" And okay, \"Let me go tackle that,\" start up the imaging process. I\\'m noticing this nice old lady has like a pretty nice gaming computer. And I\\'m like, \"This is odd.\\nI guess it\\'s possible.\" And it kind of throws me off\\nfor a minute as I\\'m like, \"Well, maybe they\\'ll image\\nfaster since it\\'s good.\" And unfortunately that was\\nlike the slowest computer and I was like, \"Where did\\nyou get this computer?\" Like \"We had the local\\nIT shop build it for us.\" And, \"Okay,\" and like,\\neverything on it was super slow. I was expecting it to\\nbe fast and it\\'s so slow that sometimes I call myself a professional progress bar watcher because I feel like I\\'m just doing things and then just watching the progress bar go until I have to do something else. And I was like, \"Gosh,\\nI don\\'t wanna sit here with all the dogs jumping on\\nme for the next six hours.\" And so I say, \"You know what? I\\'m gonna have a colleague\\ncome back tomorrow, it\\'ll be done by tomorrow\\nand it\\'ll just go overnight and come pick it up.\" So in the meantime, I\\ntake what I\\'ve collected back to the lab for processing, and I\\'m finding that there\\nare deleted documents that have been cleared\\noutta the recycling bin and they happen to be loan documents. So the prior bookkeeper\\nwas doctoring up loans, taking the funds and had\\nbeen purchasing properties in Alaska. Obviously, it wasn\\'t\\napproved by the owner. And there was another issue where we saw vehicles being purchased, and those vehicles were being\\nput in family members\\' names. And so the nice old lady\\nfinds out about this, and she turns into not\\nsuch a nice old lady. She\\'s out for blood, she wants\\nto take that bookkeeper down. She just can\\'t believe\\nanyone would do that to her. And she\\'s like, \"I donated\\nto their grandchildren\\'s, you know, sponsorship at their school, how could they do this to me?\" You know, there\\'s the betrayal set in and she was going for blood. And so she brought in the attorneys to kind of direct them and say, \"I want her in jail for that.\" And I went, \"Wow, okay.\" Lady went from this nice old lady to don\\'t mess around with this lady. And, so yeah, sure enough\\nwe give the information over to the authorities. and\\nshe finally admitted to the authorities that she\\nmade the fraudulent loan and took the funds and\\ndoctored up the agreements, and she was kind of a\\nlittle bit older herself. And so she had to do time\\nfor I think like six months and pay back what she stole. So that was an interesting\\none, interesting scenario. So you can see these\\nreally trusted individuals, keep an eye on \\'em because\\nif they\\'re left unmonitored, unchecked, they can rationalize\\ndoing things like this. And I\\'ll get into that here. So some statistics about fraud, let\\'s see if I can do the right one. So 39% of fraud concealment methods include creating fraudulent\\nphysical documents. And so the creation of a fake document, like a fake loan agreement\\nwe just talked about. 32% relate to altering of\\nphysical documents, right? So just modifying, I\\'ve seen\\nthem where PDFs get edited, you know, the total loan amounts or some amount in agreement gets edited. Then we also have 28% created fraudulent electronic documents or files. So now we\\'re talking the\\nelectronic side of it versus the physical documents. And now 25% had altered\\nelectronic documents or files and 23% of\\nfraud cases in this study had documents withheld or destroyed. So some fraud factors,\\nlet\\'s talk about that. With some factors usually come in like in three different areas. And one of \\'em is how\\nto rationalize fraud. And this is, to me, when I\\nhear that, it\\'s like the, I kind of deserve it\\ntype of scenario, right? I deserve this money then\\nopportunity and pressure. So pressure, they\\'re having\\nsome financial difficulties is usually the case. It could be personal, it could\\nbe within the organization. They\\'re getting pressured to do something to kind of maybe boost numbers and put something in different periods or create a fraudulent\\ntype of sales maybe. And then opportunity. So opportunity can occur when there\\'s not a lot of oversight. Let\\'s say there was some tech layoffs and all of a sudden the\\nsegregation of duties gets eroded and someone now has a\\nlot more on their plate and there\\'s more opportunities\\nfor some fraud to occur. So there is the fraud triangle. Anytime you see the ACFE, Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, they\\'re gonna be showing\\nyou this fraud triangle. And when you see one or more of these, there\\'s a really good\\nopportunity for fraud. So types of fraud. Asset misappropriation is really the most common form of fraud that we see, happens in 86% of fraud\\ncases that are in the study, and it\\'s actually the\\nleast costly form of fraud. So people just stealing things\\nis actually the least costly, but the most common. The other one is corruption. So that happens in about\\n50% of cases that we see where an employee or an\\nofficial misuses their position or title to kind of direct\\na business transaction. And then financial statement\\nfraud happens in 10% of the cases in the study. So the least common type, the financial statement fraud actually has the biggest impact usually\\nas it stated in the study. So it happens on only 10%, but when it does happen, it\\'s very costly. I wanna give you some fraud\\nprevention steps you can take. So there\\'s some key elements\\nto fraud prevention. Key elements would be oversight, right? So ownership or management being involved, and looking over the control environment and setting that tone at the top. Employees and vendor\\nscreening, really important. I\\'ll talk a little bit\\nmore about that later, and establishing internal controls. So having some proper authorizations, multiple layers of authorizations,\\nexception reporting, data analytics, let\\'s see, and some policies and procedures in place. So now we wanna talk about\\nthis is how to apply it, how to take this back and take action. And it\\'s really the fraud\\nprevention checklist that developed by the ACFE. I wanna run through these with you. \"Is ongoing anti-fraud training\\nprovided to all employees and the organization? Is an effective fraud\\nreporting mechanism in place? Is the management\\nclimate/tone at the top one of honesty and integrity? Are fraud risk assessments\\nperformed to proactively identify and mitigate the company\\'s vulnerabilities to internal and external fraud?\" And at the end, the\\npresentation will be available, so you don\\'t have to jot this down, but if you would like it,\\nI can email it to you. I\\'ll have my contact\\ninformation at the end. Continuing on onto the\\nfraud prevention checklist. \"Are strong anti-fraud controls in place, and operating effectively,\\nincluding the following? So proper segregation of\\nduties, use of authorizations, physical safeguards, job\\nrotations, mandatory vacations.\" So I could see on one of the\\nexample of the case study where the bookkeeper got rotated out. That was detected by job rotation. \"Does the hiring policy\\ninclude the following? Past employment verification, criminal and civil background checks, credit checks, drug screening,\\neducation verification, and reference checks,\\nobviously where law permits.\" So those will help kind of hit off any issues from the start. Continuing on. \"Are employees, do they\\nhave support programs in place to assist employees that are struggling\\nwith addiction, mental, emotional, health, family\\nor financial problems? Is an open-door policy in\\nplace that allows employees to speak freely about pressures, providing management with the opportunity to alleviate such pressures\\nbefore they become acute? And are regular anonymous\\nsurveys conducted to assess employee\\'s morale?\" So with that, actually I\\nwas gonna ask if we could maybe ask the audience if there\\'s\\nany Q and A, is that okay? So getting near the end\\nof the presentation, wanted to see if there\\'s any\\nquestions on the case studies or the metrics I provided\\nor just any insights at all. Yeah, sir, I think I\\ncan hear you just fine, but I\\'ll repeat what you said. - [Speaker] I hope. - [Aaron Reyes] Yeah. (laughs) - [Speaker] Okay, I\\ncan use the microphone. - [Aaron Reyes] Oh,\\nthey do. Okay. (laughs) - [Attendee] So you briefly\\nspoke about fraud reporting. So how effective or how much of a priority should a whistleblower program be? My experience, that\\'s how\\na lot that gets caught. - [Aaron Reyes] That\\'s a great question. Thank you for coming up\\nand asking that question. It\\'s incredibly important. In fact, the school\\ndistrict case study I had, it wasn\\'t until a whistleblower program came into was put in place\\nthat it was reported. So the, the top executive\\nof that school district had come on board and implemented\\na whistleblower program. It was almost like they\\nwere waiting for someone to say it was okay to come forward because prior to that, the tone of the top and the culture of the school district wouldn\\'t allow such reporting. So great question. Appreciate that. - [Attendee 2] Alright, you\\ntalked about tone at the top. Say a company is constantly\\nin the news getting in trouble because things are falling\\napart, they\\'re having issues. Are they now more susceptible\\nto that insider threat because the company as\\na whole has just, again, it\\'s all at the top. Do they become... Now they\\'re a target. - [Aaron Reyes] Yeah. That\\'s\\ninteresting to think of. I haven\\'t thought about it,\\nbut I can see your point and I think there\\'s a lot of validity to that point that could occur. So good insights there. Thank you. Alrighty. Any other comments or questions? Alright, well I\\'ll give you some time back and I thank you so much for\\nhanging with me the last hour and I hope you have a great\\nrest of your conference. Thank you.

I\\'d like to welcome you to\\nour next session titled, \"The One About Control.\" Please help me welcome our speaker, Sri, Deputy CISO at Genpact, to the stage. (audience claps) - Thank you everyone. Thanks for making it here. I stand between you and Alicia Keys. I know. A tough job, right? She has a tough act to follow, isn\\'t it? I take it that way. There\\'s apparently some sort of similarity between two of us. We were born in the same month. Beyond that, I can\\'t near\\nmatch her skills on stage. So you have to do with me for today. My name is Sriram. I go by Sri, make it easier\\nfor everybody\\'s life. What I\\'m gonna share today is my opinion. I would not like it to be\\nattributed to the employer, past, present, or future, but I\\'m hoping that\\nyou\\'ll enjoy the session. And what\\'s with the title? Some people say titles don\\'t matter. Sometimes they do, right? I\\'m assuming the presence\\nthat I have in the room here also got intrigued with the title. \"The One About Controls.\" It does have a inspiration,\\nif I can say that, from one of the very\\nfamous television series, mostly in the States, right? And I\\'m hoping some of\\nthat humor might rub off. If I don\\'t, please raise\\nyour hand, yell at me, scream at me, and we\\'ll\\nhave a conversation. The second part, there\\'s\\na camera right there. I\\'m told there may be an option that you may get called for\\nHollywood or some other roles. If you engage with me, maybe I\\'ll take you up with\\nthat role as well, right? Alright, thank you so\\nmuch for making it here. I\\'m gonna start here. We\\'ve already covered the disclaimer. Now, in the 19 late\\nthirties and early forties, Abram Maslow came up with the idea of what does the human\\ngets motivation with? The ideas prang around the fact that everybody behaves\\nthings needs differently. And that is determined by\\neither the circumstance or the current need to fulfill something, some real thing or some\\naspirational things. Now, in his mind, everybody\\nwants to make sure that their safety needs\\nare done first, right? You need your home, you need your shelter, you need your food. Beyond which is where you want to go to the fancy cars, right? So that\\'s the principle of how I thought about thinking\\nabout controls as well. When you think about controls, there is a huge list of things\\nyou can do and want to do. But then, what you really need is\\nsomething that is determined either by your circumstance or by the fact that it\\'s\\nthe need for your business or by the fact that it\\'s\\nsomething that you like. It may not be required for the company. It does happen. I\\'m sure some of you may\\nappreciate that context. Now, Abraham Maslow also thought about in his original 1943, I\\nbelieve, depiction as a pyramid, like the one that I was showing you. But I\\'d like you to think\\nabout it differently. All of us have phases in life. We go up and down. Imagine yourself plucking\\nthe fruit from this tree. If you\\'re in a pyramid format, do you think you\\'re going to\\nget the fruit from every level? Probably not, right? The ripest fruit usually is\\nalso in the bottom, right, that also gets plucked the fastest. Think about it this way. So you go up and down in life, you go up and down in adjusting\\nyour controls as well. That is the premise I\\'m\\ngonna share with you with some of my thoughts. All right. If you\\'ve been to London, imagine that wonderful weather and meet Ana, recently born, right? Ana grew up and was born\\ninto a very affluent family, the richest in the London. She grew up to... She kind of grew, had\\nstuff that she needed. She made sure... No, her parents made sure that she had the education she needed. Remember, she\\'s affluent, but her need to prove herself\\nto the world was immense. That drove her to do studies in law. She became a very prominent lawyer over her journey of life, right? But then after a certain point, money, fame, the fancy cars, the fancy house probably\\ndon\\'t make enough sense. You probably need to make sure that the self-actualization kicks in. You wanna give back to the society. And that\\'s where she was. She went ahead and made a point\\nto give back to the society by being pro bono to a lot of these social\\ncauses back in London. I want you to keep this\\nthought with you for a moment and then say hello to Ramamoorthy. Say hello. We also call him Rama. This chap grew up in a city\\ncalled Bangalore back in India, which is where I\\'m from, not very far from this chap\\'s house, driving distance. Now Rama wanted to be doing\\nsomething very different in the space of, you know,\\nit\\'s a startup cultures. Standing in front of you in Bay area, not talking about startup is going to be like crime, I guess. So Rama wanted to establish\\nsomething of a startup product in the city of Bangalore. The conditions are different. The city is different. The ecosystem is different, but not really. So he wanted to establish\\nhimself as a player in the cloud. He wanted, he figured out a problem that accounts payable\\nthat companies need to do aren\\'t sufficient, and he wanted to make\\nsure there\\'s a product to do just that. And that\\'s what he figured\\nout and went about. Now, he wanted his website to have a certain set of features. He wanted to make sure it\\'s\\naccessible to his B2B customers. And those features were\\nmaking sense to them. And that\\'s how he grew. He made sure he made enough millions and sort of set down his journey to make the product a success. So we\\'ll come back to him in a bit. At some point, these two stories merge. And no, I\\'m not talking about any matrimonial connections here. The two story come together\\nbecause Rama went global and he needed a global lawyer. Say hello to Ana. All right. Now, coming back to the\\ncore of the topic: controls. I\\'d like to define controls as something that you run, manage, direct or restrain to a certain desired outcome. Right? Now they are needs, like we\\'re discussing earlier. Some are real, you need them. Or some are aspirational, you probably don\\'t need them. Or maybe not just now. It\\'s an idea that\\'s whose\\ntime may not have come. I\\'d like to think about the\\ncontrols in a lifecycle format and that\\'s what I\\'m gonna share with you. Think about the lifecycle where it starts with\\nidentification of controls and goes through a process of selection, implementation, its validation,\\nand its refinement, right? So there are regulations that can impact. There are... There\\'s supposed to be an\\nanimation here, by the way. NIST standards, standards such as NIST can come about and influence that. Your decision to choose\\nISO series, for example, can influence that. Or the standards like PCIDSS and so on. Okay. Now it comes. I spoke ahead of myself, I guess. The cool thing to remember here that there will be some intersection. The size is not a representation\\nof the intersection, okay? It\\'s just visual that I\\nwanted to convey to you that most of these standards, most of these requirements will overlap. Okay? Just bear that in mind. All right. So once you have the set of\\ncontrols you wish to acquire or wish to work on, you may want to classify\\nthem in some form or fashion. Humans like to keep things\\nin some structure, isn\\'t it? So that\\'s the approach that\\nI\\'m gonna propose to you. You could go it by domains that are commonly known\\nin the cyber world, like identity and access. You could do the rest of\\nthe others like perimeter, do it on the cloud, do it by physical security\\nand what have you. Don\\'t forget the human element there. But don\\'t forget the process there, right? The element of controls\\nthat you need in a process and we\\'ll soon discover\\nwhy that\\'s relevant will become important for\\nthe overall functioning to the business objective\\nof the control structure. All right, you may also, the world famous cybersecurity\\nframework, version two, NIST adapt to that. I\\'m not expecting you to read this visual, but essentially choose\\na method that you fit, you find fit. All right. I also want to think about controls in some sort of a structure again, such as controls have domains, domains have subdomains, and those subdomains\\nhave control objectives. One or more. Each of those control objectives by itself may have one or\\nmore control statements. Each of those control statements by itself will have some requirements or configuration elements. All right. Now here comes Rama again, right? Remember he is starting his business, he is establishing. He is going global. He wants to do a little\\nbit of, you know, choices. So what did he do? He, let\\'s say we stick to\\nthe domain of identity and access management. He chose these three areas. Obviously, these are examples. The ellipse, the last bottom box there\\nindicates there are more choices. We are just gonna stick to two. Let\\'s say he focuses on\\nauthentication and authorization. If you pick up the authentication, these are the three choices of control objectives we\\nare gonna cover today. One, he\\'s making sure that when he makes his app available to consumers or businesses, he wants individual to\\nhave unrestricted access or do access, and then he wants to make sure\\nthat accounts are kept safe. I shouldn\\'t be able to access this gentleman\\'s\\ndata for example, right? For that, he wanted to make\\nsure that while this happens, the authentication method should meet complex password requirements. That is his vision. And for that, there are some more requirements which are more specific to okay, A, B, and C control\\nelements configuration wise. Okay. And authorization wise,\\nlet\\'s say he goes there and talks about\\nmultifactor authentication. All right. Having chosen what he wants to, like regulations, like ISO series. These are his choices, mind you. Your choices may be different. He thinks that threat\\nintelligence is important for his universe of controls\\nor the Mitre framework or CISs for that matter. CIS for that matter. By the way, I do not represent any of\\nthese organizations, right? And if you look at that section, maybe he wants to focus on what the regulators\\nand the customers need, what the company\\'s objectives are. Remember he wants to go global,\\nhe wants to make big money and wants to make sure his\\napplication is successful and the culture element of it. There is another constraint\\nin this ecosystem. Not enough capability or\\ncapacity will be available, isn\\'t it? There is just won\\'t be enough\\namount of money to put in. So that capability and that\\ncapacity becomes relevant. And for me, what\\'s\\nimportant in this choice is what the focus should be. Of course, the dollars. If you don\\'t have the dollars, there\\'s none of this is gonna be true. So how does he go about\\nselecting some of them? So let\\'s say, we\\'ll take four examples. Let\\'s say from the regulation space, he says the process reports that the operations generate\\nshall need to be secure. Right? He says the ISO standard tells him to have multifactor authentication. Or for that matter, the threat intel requires digital rights as a measure to be introduced\\nfor his company\\'s brand. And finally, from the Mitre framework, relevant application input\\ncontrols are required. Remember, this is payment\\napplication, right? So he found it fit to implement or choose that, select that. But remember we spoke about\\ncapacity, capability and cost. All four were not possible for him. So he chose these three. Okay, having chosen, somebody has to go and do the job now. And that\\'s the piece where I come to the configuration element here. Okay. If I\\'m going too fast, you can raise your hand and let me know. So let\\'s say if he distill\\nthe regulations part, the process controls to\\nbe relevant and secure, he chose these two\\nelements of broad controls of how he thought about it, right? And I spoke about culture\\njust a few minutes ago. Remember one of his choices\\nfrom the culture element is he wants to make sure that the outbound emails are screened. You may argue that that\\'s\\na technical control, but that\\'s also a control\\nof how the operation of the fabric, rather the fabric of\\nthe company\\'s culture, wants to be built, right? He may choose not to screen depending on the customer\\'s\\ncontract, et cetera. But in this case, he makes\\nthe choice to screen. He also makes the choice\\nthat multifactor is required but not for all, right? He wants his business user to go ahead and access the website\\nwhichever fashion they want. Like you may be using your\\npublic available web mails today. But for his IT staff, he wanted a step up, he wanted a certain degree of\\nhigher assurance of controls. And he chose not to go\\nwith his digital rights. Remember? And these were the two elements that will not happen if\\nhe doesn\\'t choose this. So that\\'s a conscious decision he\\'s making in the context of\\nimplementing those controls. And when you\\'re looking at application, the larger part of the behavior, you know, you don\\'t want your\\ncustomer to see a 404 page, page not found, right? You wanna make sure\\nthat all the exceptions, all the input validation,\\nall the attack vectors that are, let\\'s say, on the\\nSQL injection side, et cetera, handled well. Most of them, if you\\ncover by input validation, you\\'re kind of likely to\\nbe more safe than sorry. So that\\'s the piece that he focuses on. All right. You\\'ve chosen the controls. You\\'ve implemented the configuration. Now\\'s the time to test. How many of you drive the car here, right? All of you, I guess. Once you\\'ve passed the test, you would at some point\\nwant to make sure that, or once you\\'ve taken the exam and you, at some point, want to make sure that you are really driving it well. That\\'s where your DMV comes in, I guess. The validation part therefore looks at: Is the stated objective\\nbeing met or not met? So we\\'ll see some of those examples. Here it\\'s important to think about what is it that\\nwe are going to test? What is the real exposure going to be? What is the customer or the regulator actually\\ninfluencing that decision with? Are there any certifications\\nthat are impacted with the choices we\\'ve made? Again, the capacity question, right? There are going to be, for example, the CIS and the NIST for example, have thousands of controls. I\\'m gonna be able to\\ntest all the thousands at a certain periodicity. The answer is going to be no with automation, without automation. And then there are\\nother elements of, okay, there could be some element\\nof where the posture, where the element of configuration can be automatically\\ndetermined, external surface, what have you, and what do they tell you. But then it is important to make sure that all of the assimilation\\nof the choices you\\'ve made, the controlled success of failure\\nis appropriately reported. If any of you\\'re familiar\\nwith the PDCA cycle, that\\'s what this is\\nkind of going to, right? Now remember, it\\'s important\\nthat these results are consumed by the other teams\\nwithin the organization, whether it is IT, threat intel,\\nor the defense mechanisms. Otherwise, you\\'ll have a control that may work or may not work, but the other hand does not know how the whole thing comes together. So that\\'s important. Now having talked about it, what do we measure then, right? We\\'ve so spoken about validation, but then validation\\nthrows out some numbers, validation throws out some measures. But how do we bring about the\\nstory to be like numerically or presented to the right\\nlayers of management? So you could go with any of these. They are just an example,\\nsets of examples. You could go as deep as behaviors, determining behaviors\\nand talking through it. But then some of it are more obvious like how many accounts have MFA or don\\'t, how many accounts have privilege or don\\'t, and so on so forth. And like we said, if you\\nremember the top bar there, they were the same\\ndomains we chose earlier on the slide three or four, right? Now in my mind, Metrics 101 is all about\\nmaking sure it\\'s relevant to the audience. The so-what should be more focused on, and that\\'s where the\\njourney will come from. It needs to connect to\\na business objective. The objective that Rama had to make sure that his website has a\\ncertain amount of reach, a certain amount of\\nrevenue coming out from it. That\\'s the central focus\\nof how the objective needs to be met with the controls he\\'s chosen and therefore the performance\\nof that controlled mechanism is how the objective will be met. Now there are other\\nthings that I call 3Cs, which is clear, consistent, and concise. The metric needs to be repeatable\\nfrom the same set of data, otherwise it\\'s not liable. The metric needs to be arriving at the same inference, right? If two people look at\\nthe same sets of data, the presentation layer may change, but the analysis should\\nnot ideally change. And again, I personally believe that this is a pretty important\\nelement of formatting. The element of how the data\\nis presented is important. Think for yourself. When you go and buy an Apple product in a very well lit,\\nwide, beautiful showroom versus a mom and pop shop\\nsomewhere down the street with some other brand of the phone, which one are you likely to choose given that you may have the\\nsame amount of money, right? The chances are that you\\'ll\\ngravitate to a better brand. And that presentation is important. And again, I don\\'t work for Apple. And then like I said, business objective and therefore the outcome driven. So they\\'re like corresponding\\nlayers of the metric. Now think about all of\\nthis will generate hundreds and tens and gigs of data. It\\'ll also generate a lot of\\nvalue that has to be told, the story has to come out. But everybody thinks about\\nthat number differently, right? If you talk about the\\nlayer in the management, the strategic layer\\nwants to look at a data in a different set. The tactical layer or the\\nmid-management wants to look at it with a different layer of lens, and the operational guy\\nneeds far more detail, two hands and keyboard\\nto work on it, right? What I\\'ve tried to depict is the ladder because you go up and down the choice, and then remember that\\nthe details on metric largely are more as you grow up that go on the right of the ladder, which is you have tactical\\nand the operational layers. And if you go strategic, it\\'s very, very unlikely that\\nyou\\'ll need too much detail. There may be some detail-oriented\\nsenior management folks as well, but then it\\'s easier\\nto build that story there. In my view, here are some examples. Right? Like I said, the CxO layer\\nlooks at the big picture, the mid-management plans about, \"Okay, here are the problems to fix, here\\'s what the metric is telling\\nme, what do I need to do?\" And then the practitioner\\nactually goes about doing so. And again, in my opinion, these\\nare five dimensions I chose to bring to the management layer where our desired control is, which is in the dark blue line, and where our current status is because the controls may have not worked as optimally as you want based\\noff cost, based off capacity, or even time, right? For example, I\\'m assuming people here know that you can really patch every machine every single time a patch\\ncomes out, isn\\'t it? The answer is no. And that gap could be\\na function here, right? Alright, the mid-management layer may want to know a little bit\\nmore than this pythogram. I favor this pythograph. I like that representation. But the bar graph will tell you, hey, when I examine the\\ncontrol on this app or that app or these APIs, here are the three or four\\ncontrol gaps that we found. Here is the depth of issues that we found that may not have been sufficient, right? So this information is then consumed in a much more detail by the next layer, which is the tactical layer, sorry, the operational layer. Here if you see, it has far more detail than\\nalso the choices to be made. For example, in this case, the application to where the\\ncontrols were validated, tested is going to be decommissioned\\nin a certain timeframe. Therefore some of these\\ncontrols are not going to be remediated. That\\'s an information the\\npractitioner needs to know because he doesn\\'t need to spend or she doesn\\'t need to spend time on that. And that\\'s where the magic comes from in terms of prioritization as well. Okay. Now let\\'s go back to having tested, some action has already been generated. Some refinements will\\nhave to happen, right? Some controlled tweak, configuration element\\ntweak will have to happen. So here\\'s what influences\\nsome of those tweaks. Metrics like what we just spoke of, security incidents, external breathing. We come to forums such as this, know about lots of things, AI included, and that can influence what\\nyour refinement should be. I\\'m sure many of you have\\nattended several sessions, keynotes, et cetera, and have taken some learning to take back to your organization. And that will also trigger\\nsome of these refinements. You may also look through\\nyour historical issues, historical risks, and then try to tweak based\\non the current capacity, capability and cost. And then the technology changes. Now everybody in under this\\nplanet today talks about AI, right? So that change is going to trigger some refinements\\nsomewhere in your ecosystem. And finally, some of those\\nthreat intelligence feeds, like the way your attack vector or your threat actors are\\nacting in your area of work, or your vertical or your businesses will\\ntrigger some more action. And that\\'s the piece\\nthat I believe can lead to more refinements. That refinement that you\\'ve chosen now will also have to be implemented. So it\\'s almost like a cyclical process. But think about it this way, as well. When you refine a control, there may be a situation where you are upping some\\nof the controls requirements and therefore you\\'re able to reduce some of the control requirements. Think about it this way, the example I have for you is, let\\'s say you have your password set to be about 10 characters today. And let\\'s say you increase that to 14. Once you do that, you may have an option based\\noff all historical trends, threat intel, what have you, that you don\\'t necessarily need to change the password\\nevery 90 days, isn\\'t it? You may choose to do so 180 days or maybe, I don\\'t know, 365 days. So that\\'s the piece of refinement that you have to consciously think about that the refinement may\\nmean increasing or reducing. When I say reducing, I don\\'t\\nmean the efficacy of it, I only mean the depth of it or the level of it in that sense, right? Because there are enough\\ncompensating controls in the ecosystem to bring that about. All right, so let\\'s now map it\\nto Rama\\'s areas of controls. So remember he chose these and he chose threat intel\\nnot to be implemented, but based on the input he\\ngot from his threat intel, he now decides to refine them with, including a DRP product and onboarding it for at least his execs and then go forward with some of the other code repositories. Because remember, he\\'s\\na guy who builds code, builds applications. So some of those newly added\\ncontrols are basically going to add to his control\\nrepository hereafter. Here for you is the whole story that I was trying to weave\\nin whatever last 20 minutes. This is the lifecycle and that\\'s the repository of\\ncontrols that you can consider. That\\'s, again, not a finite picture. You can have more, but\\nI\\'d like you to make sure that you remember these three Cs: capability, capacity, and cost. They will always be probably\\nthe influencing factor of what your choices are. They\\'re also going to\\nbe influenced by your, I\\'m saying upbringing\\nin a very loose term, essentially your\\ncircumstances, your choices of the environment that\\nyou may have experienced. All right. Almost at the end. AI, as you can imagine, will disrupt. There are some methods that\\nI think it may disrupt with, but then there are far\\nmore experts in this room and in the buildings that would\\'ve already spoken\\nmillion times about AI and how are they gonna disrupt. So think about those assimilations for you and how those will drive the refinements in your areas of work. So that broadly is my positioning of what one our controls is. And here\\'s what I think you can take back. For you to make sure that\\nyou\\'re making the right choices, focus on what your capabilities, what your capacities, and what your cost lever is. There is not going to be a finite answer. It\\'s not, if many of you may be from the\\nsecurity consulting business, right? There\\'s a very common\\nphrase that consultants use. Ask me a question. It may start with, well it depends. And that\\'s what this is at, right? So there\\'s not gonna be a finite answer to what controls should I choose? Well, I don\\'t know. It depends. The control library, there\\'s an example of it, like the CISs repository. You can choose to use that. It has a pretty detailed one. There are other standards as well. I was listening to a\\nsession earlier today. There is apparently an open source forum where some of these standards\\nare already correlated. So you can leverage that. You also need to be very cognizant and very conscious about\\nthe level you are at and where you want to be, the desired and the current level, right? And therefore figure out\\nwhat delta you need to do to refine your control environment\\nand go forward from it. There is another framework\\nfrom NIST called the OSCAL. It basically allows the assessment and the control to kind\\nof talk to each other, basically using JSON and such. And that I believe will help you automate and do a lot of these\\ncontrol validation exercises much, much faster and more reliably. Weeding out the manual effort there. In my mind, this will probably take you about six to nine months. I don\\'t have a breakup by\\nthree months to nine months. Guess why? Because it depends. It\\'s your choice. It\\'s your organization. I can\\'t dictate that. But those choices are available. However, the final piece that I\\'d like to share\\nwith you is oftentimes, and I\\'ve seen it enough in my life, that we forget the foundation. We forget the basic layers of controls. If you read up on any of these advisories and any of these\\ninformation that\\'s available on what the attack vector is doing, threat actors are doing, nine out of 10 times, I bet you, it will be either a weak configuration that was supposed to be\\nfixed before I was born and/or weak passwords, right? Of course these are just two examples, but largely people forget the basics. If you don\\'t remember your A, B, C, D, it\\'s unlikely that you\\'ll make a sentence. That will be relevant for long term. So that\\'s the piece that\\nI\\'d like to leave you with and open it with questions. I think I\\'m super ahead of time, but... Questions please. I don\\'t want you to miss Alicia\\'s... I\\'m just saying. Please. - One... Hello? Yeah. One thing that I think we end\\nup doing in the industry is that we implement controls\\nbut we don\\'t retire them. I mean I understand that refinement, it\\'s like you put more\\nmoney or less money, but the retirement of controls. I think it\\'s very-\\n- Retirement of controls? - Yeah.\\n- Yeah, okay. - It\\'s very hard-\\n- So if you notice that if I... You said retirement, right? - Yes.\\n- Yeah. - I think it\\'s very hard for human beings to get rid of stuff.\\n- Agree. - Yeah, so... - So I bundled it in\\nrefinements as an example. The idea was that when the environments are\\nsupposed to be decommissioned, for me it was a function of refinement because when you lessen\\nthe attack surface, remove the control requirement, that\\'s a refinement\\nfor me, but fair point. I mean, we can elaborate on that as well. Thank you. Okay. Yes, please. - Hi. So in your example up there, there was basically one product that was being, you know, controls were being established for. Say in an organization, there\\'s several different\\nproducts, different teams. Is there, do you see risk in trying to establish kind of a\\norganization wide set of controls? - Yes.\\n- And what could those be? - Thank you for your question. But think about it like this. If you remember my bubble chart where there was a lot of controls and that intersection was depicted, think about that intersection\\nto be your finite list of controls for the organization. Most often, right? And then there will be a delta app. For example, you want to\\ndo something more special for your AWS or for any\\nof your cloud presence and therefore you want to\\nmake it more stringent. Think about them as bolt-ons\\nto your control library, applicable to a scope that is beyond the larger part of the enterprise ones, right? And that is definitely possible and that\\'s something you should do. But then again, the\\nscoping question is again, a function of capacity\\nand capability, right? And that\\'s the reason I\\nwas trying to connect it to the capability and capacity. Because if you, like the example of multifactor, right, Rama didn\\'t choose to implement\\nmultifactor for everyone. It was for a business purpose, but it is also for a reason\\nof cost maybe in that fashion. I hope that answers. - Thanks. - Cool. I don\\'t have swags to\\ngive every few questions. Alright, I think that\\'s it. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. Hope this was useful.', 'drive': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oh9WtzX8ZKkHjB_SjPxYuUFQR45U5i-1'}\n"
